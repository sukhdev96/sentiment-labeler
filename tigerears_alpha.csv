Saya akan bantu proses permohonan Tuan/Puan sehingga lulus.••••••••••••••••••••••••Benefits of Merchant Terminals for BusinessesMaking PaymentsAlthough having card terminals in your business would incur some costs, it provides the business with flexible payment options available to the customers. In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal KadMembuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6QVisa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Carde-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPayWith built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式）Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps:1.

And I've recently gotten my REN Tag , meaning I am too a property agent... a freshie if you will With that said My income for the years 2018 - 2019 is about RM6k -ish a month. I've started to file taxes in 2019 as I realize that I would want to buy a house one day and tax documents might come in handy. Also I took 3 Credit cards from Maybank , Shoppee , GRAB , Petronas cards. To help with my CCRIS. I've never incurred debt on these cards and also pay within 10 days. 2020 sadly was a rough year for me. My income was hit. Averaging 3-4k a month. Anyways I'll file for 2 years 2019 , 2020 and also having a few CC With that said I wanted to get a house in 1-2 years time. I decided to ask my team leader. He said my situation is going to be difficult as my job is considered unstable by the banks. Hence. He told me to use buy under someone else's name or register a Business Bank Account ( which I have ) and start placing money in and use it as a salary for yourself and show it to the bank as proof of income. Anyways any sifus can teach me ?Easiest way and fastest way is find a job, work for 3 to 6 months.apply quickly with those documents. get your desired house.many people do that, rather than trying to improve your document which you got no control on how to bring in more income/revenue. even with income/revenue you still have many things to prove to bank because bank dont believe you.imagine i use 50k, i pump in to myself as Salary month say 10k. after 3 months, i can recycle my 30k salary into the same account just to create a illusion of earning 10k per month.that is why for sole prop is even more difficult to prove. for sdn bhd all accounts is audited by external auditors thus more reliable.

My issue with Maybank is that I requested for a renewal of my credit card since last year, but they can't even satisfy my request even after 3 months. I'm tired of calling customer service but can't get through because it's too busy, then told to email customer service, only to get a reply telling me to call customer service.Even when I get through, I get the same response saying they'll arrange it but lo and behold, nothing happens, even after I've requested the same thing every month for 3 months. I even asked them if I can get things done faster if I just go the card center myself but they said no, just patiently wait for my new card.

I pay RM8 annual fees for both.I called Maybank and they say I can walk in to any branch to change to a “free” version with limited withdrawals. I am okay with this.However, OCBC says no such options exist. The best I can do is cancel the debit card entirely. Are both the above true?Yes, Both are true.The current Maybank Savings Account-i is actually a regular Maybank Islamic savings account and if you do not want to pay annual fee for the debit card, you'll only get 4 free ATM withdrawals every month.

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal KadMembuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6QVisa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Carde-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPayWith built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式）Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps:1.

477,lowyat,"QUOTE(snowswc @ Mar 16 2021, 02:07 PM)If Grab has no isse to save the same card into two grab accounts, i think it should be fine. Just my guessing:1. I don't think Maybank will have the info/access to know you are topping up to two grab accounts except grab.2. If not mistaken, the extra point is given by maybank because that include others spending (2 GRP & x1 GRP) and it can be tracked in your monthly Maybank statement.3. In this case, i believe Maybank will provide the info to Grab on a regular basis for Grab to credit the points into your account based on the registered mobile number. So i guess the ""topup"" on the second account will be credited to first account. if anyone has tried this, perhaps can comment on this point.4. so far i didn't notice any capping on the points, so topup to 2 grab accounts max can earn RM20k * 5 GRP = 100k points monthly (just top up).feel free to comment if i made the wrong assumption or anyone here has diff experience using this card.Thanks. Tested and it works. Your assumptions are correct. 👍👍",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan.

As for the points whether will be given to both, I have no idea already cos I don’t know how grab handle the x5 top up points.If Grab has no isse to save the same card into two grab accounts, i think it should be fine. Just my guessing:1. I don't think Maybank will have the info/access to know you are topping up to two grab accounts except grab.2. If not mistaken, the extra point is given by maybank because that include others spending (2 GRP & x1 GRP) and it can be tracked in your monthly Maybank statement.3. In this case, i believe Maybank will provide the info to Grab on a regular basis for Grab to credit the points into your account based on the registered mobile number. So i guess the ""topup"" on the second account will be credited to first account. if anyone has tried this, perhaps can comment on this point.4. so far i didn't notice any capping on the points, so topup to 2 grab accounts max can earn RM20k * 5 GRP = 100k points monthly (just top up).feel free to comment if i made the wrong assumption or anyone here has diff experience using this card.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfer all your funds there first and you're able to set up to RM500k FPX limit in Bank Islam. However, I've never been able to transfer more than RM30k per transaction via FPX but have successfully performed multiple transactions per day within the RM500k limit. A Google search shows that the RM30k limit per transaction is an FPX-wide limit for all banks applicable to personal/non-corporate banking.I understand that Maybank has an unchangeable FPX limit at RM30k per transaction but you're able to perform transfers of up to RM50k per day, possible with at least 2 transactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Downside is you have less money left to invest. Over long time, amount adds up. Your choice.3. Subject to TD exchange rate also.4. Take > 6 months for account to be opened.TSG-IBKR1. One free withdrawal a month. More than that you pay.2. Accept third party transfer but money takes longer to enter Vs using direct deposit from sg banks under your own name.- maybe required to submit proof of transfer 6-7 months down the road if using 3rd party transfer.3. Not tedious to set up as everything is online.You just sign-up via whitelabels page and subsequently login using IBKR site. Funding also uses IBKR bank account. Trading will take place on IBKR site.4. Interface for TWS is not user friendly. Client portal is ok.5. The USD 2.5k involve your portfolio value so you don't have to actually park USD 2.5k cash inside. You just deposit Usd2.5k of cash and start investing. Just make sure the amount you have inside is > USD2.5k (very easy to achieve overtime)6.If you use pure IBKR (non whitelabel) you have access to fractional shares.7. IBKR rates are real time rates without any markup.8. Commision are dirt cheap at USD1.50 for whitelabels and USD0.35 for pure IBKRMajority of ark stuff are not having any profit and don't pay a dividend. So dividend is of no importance if you are investing in ark. Buying ark directly is cheaper. Annual fees of 0.6-0.7% Vs 1.5-1.6% if you go via unit trust route.SC blacklist doesn't even concern me at all cause SC blacklist is politically motivated. If it passed US, and SG regulatory bodies, who cares.Hope this help.Thanks for the correction Ramjade. I just want to ask if there a withdrawal limit with TDA? I was funding by IBKR account by using the method below[Maybank acc] -> [instarem] - > [US Account] -> via ACH -> IBKR (whitelable)but the settling time for the money is like 1 week.

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal KadMembuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6QVisa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Carde-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPayWith built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式）Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps:1.

Saya akan bantu proses permohonan Tuan/Puan sehingga lulus.••••••••••••••••••••••••Benefits of Merchant Terminals for BusinessesMaking PaymentsAlthough having card terminals in your business would incur some costs, it provides the business with flexible payment options available to the customers. In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal KadMembuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6QVisa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Carde-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPayWith built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式）Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps:1.

619,lowyat,"Which method do you think Maybank Secure2U use to treat the smartphone as a secure token to verify your transaction?https://doubleoctopus.com/blog/2017-phone-a...fits-and-risks/One Time Password (OTP) Appsin which one-time password software tokens generate OTPs using the same keys (“seed values”) and algorithms as traditional OTP hardware tokens. The authentication takes place when the user enters the OTP on the login screen:My guess is it is probably some form of this above. A seed value is generated and stored on both Maybank server and your smartphone, which is later used to randomly generated a sequence of hash values. And then each authentication request essentially need the smartphone to match the randomly generated value with the value generated from the server. The idea is since other smartphones does not have the same seed value, it cannot generate the same value to authenticate the request.The risk factors will then be:1. How safe is the seed value being stored on the smartphone. Can someone lets say a repair shop getting hold of your smartphone can clone the value easily?2. If some how your money is transferred away by someone else, you have no easy mean to claim from Maybank that you did not execute the transfer. The dispute is purely between you and Maybank with no other party involved. If Maybank insists that you are responsible, there is little chance that you can prove otherwise. Solution, try not to put in too much money in an account where Secure2U can transfer the money easily. Maybe keep most of the money in FDs can help?Based on this assumption, then it becomes very critical that:1. Do not give your smartphone to anyone for ""borrow to make a call"" purpose. As this might allow a stranger to clone your data and hence able to impersonate you to transfer your money away.2. Anytime you have to leave your smartphone to someone else without you able to observe it, you might want to cancel Secure2U first before you let go of the phone. This will include obvious cases like selling your phone, send the phone to repair, even give it to your children for vacation use etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Even who are the contributors of funds and how much donations are received were also never informed and presented to the other Yayasan Akalbudi trustees,” Khairudin told the High Court, adding that the other trustees only knew that the foundation carried out welfare activities especially for residents of Bagan Datuk relating to donations to mosques and tahfiz centres.The credit card paymentsKhairudin said his investigations showed that Yayasan Akalbudi’s funds were issued via 43 cheques from its Affin Bank account to pay for credit card bills under Zahid and his wife’s names between 2014 and 2016, including overseas expenditure.“Based on documents and witness statements, the total Yayasan Akalbudi funds used by Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to pay for his credit card for personal use is RM1,362,037.81,” he told the court, also listing evidence he had obtained from banks on these payments including the original cheques and the credit card statements.This amount included 35 cheques from Yayasan Akalbudi’s Affin Bank account for payment totalling RM1,296,715.98 or over RM1.2 million for Zahid’s two AmBank credit cards — AmBank Islamic Visa Infinite and AmBank Islamic World Mastercard — and his wife’s four supplementary credit cards from January 2014 to January 2016.Also included in the RM1.36 million amount were seven cheques from Yayasan Akalbudi for payment totalling RM34,686.03 for Zahid’s two Maybank credit cards — Visa Platinum and Mastercard Gold — from February 2014 to March 2015; and one cheque in July 2015 from the foundation for the amount of RM30,635.80 for Zahid’s American Express Platinum credit card.Zahid’s lawyers had previously disputed and argued that he had not actually approved the use of a stamp of his signature on the Yayasan Akalbudi cheques that were used to pay the credit card bills, but his former executive secretary Major Mazlina Mazlan @ Ramly had while testifying as the 90th prosecution witness disagreed with such arguments.The vehicle insurance and road taxKhairudin also told the court today that his investigations had shown that Yayasan Akalbudi funds were used to pay for insurance policies and road tax for 20 vehicles under his name, his wife’s name and two others, via three cheques totalling RM107,509.55 from the foundation’s Affin Bank account.The first cheque in January 2015 was for RM24,980.55 was for six vehicles owned by Zahid and his wife, namely RM17,335.54 for insurance policies and RM7,625.01 for road tax.The second cheque in April 2015 was for RM43,645 (RM27,246.90 for insurance policies and RM16,368.10 for road tax for four Zahid-owned vehicles, one BZ Motors Sdn Bhd-owned vehicle and one Juhari Janan-owned vehicle), while the third cheque in September 2015 was for RM38,884 (RM27,607.11 for insurance policies and RM11,276.89 for road tax for eight Zahid-owned vehicles).The 20 vehicles include Toyota Vellfire vehicles, a BMW X5 car, a BMW 320i car, a Lexus LX 570 car, an Audi Q7 4.2(A) car, a Mini Cooper S car, a Honda Odyssey car, a Chrysler Wrangler car, and motorcycles under brands such as Harley Davidson, BMW, Ducati and Kawasaki.Khairudin will continue testifying next Thursday, where he is expected to continue reading out his written witness statement before High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah.Earlier today, MACC investigator Christ Sheldon Anak Merun who is also the 98th prosecution witness had testified of the statement recorded from a Singapore-based businessman of how Zahid was said to have asked for a donation of RM10 million to be paid to Yayasan Akalbudi as charity to help the poor and needy.Khairudin will be the last prosecution witness to testify before the prosecution wraps up its case in this trial. Today is the 51st day of trial.In this trial, Zahid ― who is a former home minister and currently the Umno president ― is facing 47 charges, namely 12 counts of criminal breach of trust in relation to charitable foundation Yayasan Akalbudi’s funds, 27 counts of money laundering, and eight counts of bribery charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,

650,lowyat,"QUOTE(wKkaY @ Mar 11 2021, 10:52 PM)As a second factor, physical possession of a simcard is replaced by physical possession of a phone.Compromising a phone eg with remote control potentially lets you have access to the app and SMSes, so they're both equally at risk.The main problem with SMS is that someone can hijack and port out your phone number to a new SIM. It's not just a theoretical problem, it's already happened to many people overseas (my friends included) where ID checks for MNP are not as strict as over here. So your second factor isn't actually possession of a SIM, it's control of a phone number.What is the current Maybank procedure if need to switch the phone to a new one?nevermind, found in FAQ:https://www.maybank2u.com.my/WebBank/secure2u-faq.pdfYou can re-register for Secure2u on a new device at any time.

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan.

665,lowyat,"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...n-electric-car/QUOTEWhen will Proton make an electric car?K. Kathirgugan -March 11, 2021 8:00 AMEarlier this month, Proton posted its best monthly sales figure in seven years, delivering 11,873 cars in February, and capturing more than a quarter of the Malaysian automotive market share.This is welcome news as our national car brand had been plagued with problems since its inception. Most who purchased a Proton did so just because it, along with Perodua, offered the most affordable cars in the market.But with its recent acquisition by Chinese auto giant Geely, the tide seems to be turning. Both the Proton X50 and X70 were unveiled amidst much hoopla and surprisingly enough, they managed to justify it, thrilling and satisfying customers.I can’t remember a time when a Proton product was lusted over by thousands across the nation. Sure, the X50 and X70 are essentially just rebranded Geely Binyue and Geely Boyue, respectively, but they’re still a welcome addition to the Proton stable, which has needed a shot in the arm (or several), for a while now.This makes me ask the question that’s been on the minds of some since Geely’s acquisition of Proton: When will it start making electric cars?It’s a natural next step.Geely already makes a range of hybrid vehicles and even a full electric one: the Geely Emgrand EV. To boot, Geely signalled its intention to bolster its electric vehicle making capability by inking a massive deal with Chinese search giant Baidu to develop autonomous electric cars.The Emgrand EV – Geely’s fully electric car – boasts an impressive 500km range on a single charge, and charges up to 80% capacity in a mere 30 minutes.With such an impressive range, it would easily be able to handle users’ daily work commutes and end the day with plenty of juice to spare. And at 195,800 yuan (RM124,000), it’s just a tad more expensive than the range-topping variant of the Proton X70.If Proton thinks this is still out of the price range of most Malaysians, slightly reducing battery capacity, and hence its range, would go a long way towards reducing its price and making it an enticing proposition.This is why Proton Edar CEO Roslan Abdullah’s words on the matter disappointed me. When asked about Proton’s electric vehicle plans during an interview in August 2020, he said: “Proton found that the feasibility study conducted on investment and sales of EVs does not match, which means it is not a positive investment yet.”He cited lack of awareness, poor range and deficiency in electric charging infrastructure as the reasons for Proton’s reluctance to pioneer the electric vehicle market in Malaysia.He added: “We need to understand Malaysian customers’ driving behaviour. We love to drive cars from Kangar in Perlis to Johor Bahru. Imagine you drive an electric car from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Bharu in 10 hours, it will be quite difficult (without charging). It goes back to customers’ demand.”This kind of thinking is short-sighted at best.First of all, the US and China, which are home to millions of electric vehicles, have landmasses and road infrastructure far larger and more extensive than that of Malaysia. If they are embracing electric vehicles, I don’t see why Malaysians wouldn’t, if provided the option.The only major impediment I see to mass adoption of electric vehicles is the need for an abundance of electric charging stations. This is where Proton can learn from Tesla, the pioneering American electric carmaker. Realising that range anxiety was the number one issue bothering would-be electric car buyers, Tesla embarked on an ambitious mission to build electric charging stations across the US.Fast forward to today – a mere eight years later – Tesla has built 754 charging stations (supercharger stations, as they call it) across the US, and is able to cover 99% of the US population.For context, the US has a landmass that’s 75 times larger than Peninsular Malaysia and around ten times as many people. If Tesla, then a startup, could pull off such a feat, I’m sure Proton – with some smart planning, the knowhow of Geely and with the aid of government incentives – can muster it in Malaysia.Electric cars make a lot of sense. The cost of the electricity needed to run an electric car can be up to four times cheaper than the cost of using petrol. Imagine the long drive from KL to Penang costing you just around RM15.And since it has dramatically fewer moving parts, servicing is easier, less frequent and as a consequence, is cheaper than it is for a conventional, petrol-powered vehicle.Also, producing energy at a massive power plant, converting it into electricity and using that to power our cars is more efficient and environmentally-friendly than using a relatively inefficient internal combustion engine (which is essentially a mini power plant) in the car.And if paired with clean energy sources such as solar and nuclear power, these electric cars will be better and safer for the environment. At a time of climate uncertainty, this is more important than ever.This is why the government’s lack of focus on electric cars is especially frustrating. All its incessant spouting about the importance of being an IR 4.0 pioneer is pointless if not coupled with action in the electric and autonomous vehicle space, among other areas.According to Maybank Investment Bank Research, Malaysia is increasingly seen as a laggard in the electric vehicle space, due partly to the seemingly rudderless and scantily detailed initiatives in our National Automotive Policy (NAP) 2020.Instead, investors are bullish about our Southeast Asian neighbours Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia, which have each unveiled ambitious and substantial electric vehicle initiatives.Among other things, Thailand has set a goal of building 1.2 million electric vehicles by 2026 and is looking to be the region’s EV hub; Indonesia wants 20% of its overall automotive production to be electric by 2025; and Singapore plans to phase out petrol and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040.Malaysia sorely lacks such clear, definitive and ambitious electric vehicle plans.Probably catching wind of the deteriorating local landscape, Hyundai – the third largest car manufacturer in the world after Toyota and Volkswagen – has shifted its regional headquarters from Malaysia to Indonesia. This is a huge slap in the face for Malaysia and signals our increasing loss of relevance in the region.We need to reverse this terrible trend and reverse it quick. To do this, Proton should use its power and clout to build a nationwide network of charging stations, starting with major cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru, and the major highways connecting them.Concurrently, it should look at bringing an electric Geely vehicle under the Proton brand to Malaysia, just as it did with the X50 and X70. Being a pioneer in the local electric vehicle space will pay off for it in droves, allowing it to carve out a huge lead before the entry of other carmakers. The government, for its part, should provide incentives and tax breaks as it sees fit to enable Proton and others to do this.In addition, foreign hybrid and electric vehicles should not be taxed as heavily as petrol-powered cars so that more people will purchase them.These steps and more, if executed effectively, would not just be good for Proton, but also good for Malaysia, and good for the planet.",,,,,,,,,,,,

686,lowyat,"https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2...tivate-secure2uMaybank to stop issuing SMS TAC for online transactions, urges users to activate Secure2uBy ANGELIN YEOHTECHNOLOGY Thursday, 11 Mar 20214:25 PM MYT PETALING JAYA: Maybank says it will no longer be generating SMS TAC (transaction authorisation code) to approve selected online transactions on Maybank2u as it will be switching to Secure2u as the preferred authorisation method.From March 15 onwards, users will be required to utilise Secure2u to authorise bill payments and Interbank Giro (IBG) transfers of any amount on Maybank2u.The company said in a statement on its website that the move is part of an effort to provide customers with better online banking security.According to its website, Secure2u “pairs your device with your Maybank2u User ID”, providing “an extra level of security as all transactions initiated can only be authorised on your registered device”.The bank claims that Secure2u is a safer and more convenient way to authorise transactions, which can be done either by using Secure Verification (one-tap approval) or Secure TAC (six-digit TAC number generated on the Maybank2u mobile app).Secure Verification lets Maybank2u users approve or reject online transactions on their device once a notification alert on the transaction is sent to their phone.Alternatively, Secure TAC allows users to approve online transactions on the Maybank2u website by keying in the six-digit TAC number from the app.If users have already registered for Secure2u, then the service will be the default method for all transactions.To activate Secure2u, users can start by downloading the Maybank2u MY app on Google Play or Apple App store. Click on the Menu tab on the left and select Secure2u then follow the setup instructions. They will be asked to key in a one-time password sent to their phone number, enter ID number and then submit.A separate app Mae by Maybank2u also utilises one-tap authorisation method. Users will receive a notification alert on their phone and they have 50 seconds to approve or reject the transaction on the app.The company had previously made Secure2u the only authorisation method for transactions above RM5,000 starting on Feb 16, and subsequently for transactions of RM4,000 and above on Feb 24.Secure2u is currently used to authorise transactions valued at RM3,000 and above, which came into effect on March 8.After each effective date, SMS TAC was no longer generated for users.",,,,,,,,,,,,

719,lowyat,"QUOTE(Slash21 @ Mar 10 2021, 04:23 PM)Hello All,I hope this is the right forum. I would like to ask the Sifus around here for my friend about wire transfers.Is there any rules as to how much money she can wire transfer into Malaysia from Singapore, and vice versa? She needs to transfer from a Spore stock trading account to Malaysia then after a period of time, transfer back to Spore. This is because she want to buy shares in a local Malaysian IPO. The amount is in the 7 digits and she is lost, not sure how to do this. She is a Malaysian citizen and do not want to break any rules.Since it’s 7 figures go get an investment account tied to savings in Singapore’s through Maybank because they will have direct access to any IPOs listed in KLSELess hassle and easy to monitor rather than using Wire because once it’s more than rm50k AMLA flag will trigger If you have a track record not much problem just that once in a while bank audit will questionhich  normal if you have the documentationsThe question is why buy Bursa IPOs when in Singapore you have better acesss to IPOs listed in LSE, TSX, HKSE or NYSE ",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you're on the unrestricted unlimited withdrawals option, of which the fee is RM8 per annum, then you'll be charged upon card issuance and subsequently on the anniversary date.Yes. It is indeed the highest in town. Before they adopted debit MasterCard, their ATM card annual fee was RM8 too just like most other banks. RHB Bank actually had the highest debit card annual fee. The already phased out debit card (the one with the cut shaped) had an annual fee of RM20.Usually the AF is higher if you get 'special' debit card or your SA let you earn some amount of interest. Like mine I have CIMB Debit Petronas with RM 18 AF. Was a bit surprise when they charged me that. The card actually gave you a little bit CB when you buy Petronas fuel.Since I'm not really using it and mainly just to track my financing so I end up going to bank to change to BSA.

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6QVisa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Carde-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPayWith built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式）Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps: 1.

Thank you, I plead not guilty,"" he said after the charge was read to him here on Tuesday (March 9).Earlier, High Court judge Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah allowed the prosecution's application to amend the 27th charge against the former deputy prime minister and ordered the new charge to be read out.Changes made to the charge were on the amount and value of the cheques involved in the case.In the original charge, 30 cheques were involved to the sum of RM6,885,300.20.In the amended version, there are 35 cheques involved with a total value of RM7,511,250.20.According to the amended charge, Zahid is alleged to have committed money laundering by engaging in direct transactions involving proceeds from illegal activities by instructing one Omar Ali Abdullah to convert for him a cash amount of RM7,511,250.20 into 35 cheques that were later given to Messrs Lewis & Co for the opening of Maybank fixed deposit accounts.He allegedly committed the offence at Marhaba Enterprise Sdn Bhd, LG 1.15, Farenheit88,179 Jalan Bukit Bintang here, on March 29,2016 and July 15,2016.Zahid, 68, faces 47 charges, 12 for criminal breach of trust (CBT), eight for corruption and 27 for money laundering involving tens of millions of ringgit of funds from Yayasan Akalbudi.The trial continues Tuesday afternoon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6QVisa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Carde-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPayWith built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式）Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps: 1.

KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court today heard that a total of RM17.9 million funds from Yayasan Akalbudi were taken out by Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi without the approval of the charity foundation's board of trustees.This was revealed by a Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigating officer in the former deputy prime minister's trial over 47 charges of criminal breach of trust (CBT), bribery and money laundering involving tens of millions of ringgit of funds from Yayasan Akalbudi.Muhammad Fazli Zulkifli, 36, said based on his investigations, he found that CBT was committed on the RM17.9 million funds, which were used for the purchase of company shares for Zahid's daughter Datuk Nurulhidayah Ahmad Zahid as well as to be placed as fixed deposits.""There was CBT activity on the amount as it did not get the approval from the other members of the board of trustees.""The money was transferred into the client's account of law firm Lewis & Co,"" he said during re-examination by deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Sazilee Abdul Khairi.The 93rd prosecution witness said Zahid who is also the founder of Yayasan Akalbudi had instructed Messrs Lewis & Co to manage the monies.He added that the law firm would only act upon Zahid's instructions.He also confirmed that nobody on the board had given instructions to Lewis & Co specifically its partner B Muralidhahran in regards with the monies.Asked about Zahid's cautioned statement to the MACC, Fazli said he had conducted investigations on the other witnesses in relation to the statement.Sazilee: Can you explain the comparison you did with the cautioned statement by Zahid?Fazli: Based on Zahid's statement, he said Yayasan Akalbudi was interested to invest in Ri-Yaz Assets Sdn Bhd (a hotel management firm) in hotel industry while the other witnesses said that Nurulhidayah was interested to make an investment and Yayasan Akalbudi paid for it.Sazilee: How about the testimony of Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Abdul Manaf (Ri-Yaz Assets shareholder)?Fazli: According to Rashid's statement, there was a problem with the hotel in Indonesia and the solution given was either to sell off the hotel or sell his shares... Nurulhidayah then expressed interest to invest in Ri-Yaz Assets.The witness also testified that there were no documents to show that Yayasan Akalbudi invested in Ri-Yaz Assets.""The investment only involved Rashid and Nurulhidayah,"" he added.Asked whether there were any documents to show that Nurulhidayah was an observer or a proxy in Ri-Yaz Assets, Fazli answered in the negative.Last Friday, Fazli testified that Zahid was involved in the withdrawal of RM17.9 million from Yayasan Akalbudi.He said RM8.6 million was paid to Ri-Yaz Assets as deposit for a share purchase with another RM9.3 million to be placed as fixed deposits.He said Zahid instructed for the money from Yayasan Akalbudi's Affin Bank account to be transferred to a Maybank account belonging to Messrs Lewis & Co (the foundation's trustee).He also testified that Nurulhidayah had no connections with her father's charity foundation nor had held any positions in it.Zahid, 68, faces 47 charges, 12 of them for criminal breach of trust (CBT), eight for corruption and 27 for money laundering involving tens of millions of ringgit of funds from Yayasan Akalbudi.The trial continues before judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah.https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/20...boards-approval",,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently only depending on the EPF + some FDs, wanted to diversify a bit. Is gold the right choice for this purpose?From some reading I understand that for example Maybank or UOB I can just walk in their branches and cash out the coins based on the published rate. Is this correct? Just wanna make sure the flexibility in cashing out during emergencies.When purchasing bullion, try not to focus so much on spread but rather how much are you paying over spot (premium) for the said item.Always remember spread can always change from time to time and it is out of your control (this works the same for financial institutions as well).Try focusing on something which you can control such as your cost price (premium over spot) so that you are buying as close to the spot price according to your budget.The problem with UOB and MBB is that there always is no stock, the prices are not live and to my surprise, most of the chief cashier there do not even know how many grams of gold is in a troy ounce   Gets me a little nervous when they cannot even get the weight correct, how do they even test it is genuine when someone sells back? Receipt, Certificates? Those can be easily forged and reprinted.You have the proper mindset (long term) is not 3 to 5 years but rather 10, 20 or even to be used as a retirement plant as gold holds it value rather well against inflation.Always remember this, it is a marathon, not a sprint.

Currently only depending on the EPF + some FDs, wanted to diversify a bit. Is gold the right choice for this purpose?From some reading I understand that for example Maybank or UOB I can just walk in their branches and cash out the coins based on the published rate. Is this correct? Just wanna make sure the flexibility in cashing out during emergencies.The investment duration seems good. But, what about your priorities? Have u built up your Kwsp, Sspn, emergency funds, housing loans? Like previously shared, these currency investment give u dividends to supplement your income during work life n retirement. Gold doesn't give dividends, gold is just a store of value. So, pls elaborate, cashing out gold during emergencies? You can see when stocks rise, gold sleeps. When stocks fall, gold falls. So, need to be clear on your emergencies. Again my thoughts, precedence already set for general public to cash out kwsp during such trying times. Im confident kwsp will continue, so no reason for younger people NOT to max their Kwsp contributions during good times. Haha, not to frustrate you, nor any selfish intentions. Just ensure your thought process hold water. If all systems go, my next question will be what $$$ will be gold investment and/or % of your networth in gold. Paper or physical gold? Why gold? Gold is mostly bought by Central Banks, space industry n Eastern people. Why not invest in Industrial Metals like silver? Tesla, Apple, Solar companies uses lots of Ag. (On the flip side, dont u think the E Musk, T Cooks, understand the price impact of this commodity on their P&L? Im sure they're party into shorting price of Ag, Cu, Zn, etc) If we cant even trade a single stock well, theres no way we can trade Ag ($1T), Au ($8T), too many considerations n too big.Get the strategy firmed up, whether kijang, maple, kru, bar vs coin etc is  not the priority.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The money was returned to the law firm via cheque,"" he said.Muhammad Fazli said his investigations also found that Nurulhidayah was appointed as the director of Ri-yaz Assets Sdn Bhd on Jan 27,2017 to replace Abdul Rashid, who resigned as a director on the same date.He said that Nurulhidayah then resigned as a director of the company on Jan 31,2017. However, both parties, namely, Rashid and Nurulhidayah, did not proceed with the share sale and purchase agreement.""After the discontinuation of share sale and purchase agreement, Datuk Nurulhidayah and Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid requested that the money amounting to RM8.3mil be returned to Lewis & Co because it is Yayasan Akalbudi's money,"" he said.The witness also said that his investigations found that Nurulhidayah did not have any position in Yayasan Akalbudi.""At that time, Datuk Nurulhidayah was working as marketing director with Syarikat Perumahan Negara Berhad (SPNB),"" he said when answering additional questions during the examination-in-chief by Ahmad Sazilee.Ahmad Zahid, 68, faces 47 charges, 12 of them for criminal breach of trust (CBT), eight for corruption and 27 for money laundering involving tens of millions of ringgit of funds from Yayasan Akalbudi.The trial before Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues on Monday. – Bernamahttps://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021...ess-tells-court",,,,,,,,,,,,

848,lowyat,"1)YTL CEMENT GROUPMCEMENT (3794): MALAYAN CEMENT BERHADTHE local cement industry is fragmented and rife with overcapacity and low utilisation of plants. According to the Cement and Concrete Association of Malaysia, the country has 8 cement producers.8-1( larfarge )-1( tasek )=6The situation is made worse by a slowdown in mega infrastructure projects, which has led to lower demand and seen cement companies booking losses.Take Malayan Cement Bhd (formerly Lafarge Malaysia Bhd) and Tasek Corp Bhd, for example, which registered a net loss of RM132.65 million and RM22.98 million respectively for the nine-month period to Sept 30, 2019.Thus, the recent acquisition of 51% equity interest in Malayan Cement by YTL Cement Bhd, a subsidiary of YTL Corp Bhd, was a welcome respite for the industry. It also earned recognition as the best mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deal of the year.According to Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, the acquisition represents an opportunity for YTL Cement to bolster its position as a leading homegrown cement company, strengthen its ability to fulfil its regional growth aspirations and complement its existing core businesses.YTL Cement is a leading international building materials company with over 60 years of experience in manufacturing cement, construction aggregates and concrete. It offers world-class quality products and end-to-end solutions to its customers.Malayan Cement, meanwhile, is a prominent building materials leader listed on Bursa Malaysia with a market capitalisation of RM2.82 billion as at Aug 29, 2019.On May 2, YTL Cement entered into a sales and purchase agreement with Associated International Cement Ltd for the acquisition of 433.34 million shares, or a 51% stake, in Malayan Cement for RM1.63 billion or RM3.75 per share.Following the acquisition, YTL Cement was also required to extend the offer to the rest of the shareholders of Malayan Cement to buy the remaining 416.35 million shares at the same price.The mandatory offer, which closed on June 13, saw 220.72 million shares accepted, with YTL Cement holding a 77% stake in Malayan Cement.“The acquisition is expected to deliver operational efficiencies in logistics, distribution, and procurement; and cost synergies realised from economies of scale, and elimination of duplicated functions and corporate overheads; which would contribute positively to future earnings and cash flows of the enlarged YTL Cement group,” says Maybank IB.Besides being the adviser for YTL Cement for the deal, Maybank IB was the lead arranger and book runner for YTL Cement’s bridging loan facility of RM1.84 billion. The facility has a tenure of two years.Malayan Cement Bhd (formerly Lafarge Malaysia Bhd) is the largest cement producer in Malaysia with close to 40% market share. With the emergence of YTL Cement Sdn Bhd as its biggest substantial shareholders, the combined market share of these two players is 60%.The consolidation may result in price stability from more rational pricing strategies and capacity cuts, says Affin Hwang Capital in a March 3 note.2)CIMAThe Cement Division, spearheaded by Negeri Sembilan Cement Industries Sdn Bhd (NSCI), manages and operates two cement plants; in Bukit Ketri, Perlis and Bahau Negeri Sembilan.Both plants produce Ordinary Portland Cement/CEM1 (OPC), ASTM Type II Portland Cement, Low Heat Cement, Masonry Cement and Portland Composite Cement (PCC).CIMA’s wide range of cement products were extensively used in the construction of Malaysia’s key projects such as of the Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah Bridge, QUOTEThe Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge or Penang Second Bridge E28 (Malay: Jambatan Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah or Jambatan Kedua Pulau Pinang;) is a dual carriageway toll bridge in Penang, Malaysia. It connects Bandar Cassia (Batu Kawan) in Seberang Perai on mainland Peninsular Malaysia with Batu Maung on Penang Island.

Each barge is equipped with a fully enclosed dust free pneumatic loading and unloading system that enables all weather operations.The Kuching plant which has its own jetty is also equipped to receive inward bulk cement shipments for when there is a need to import bulk cement. Bintulu plant adjoin Bintulu port where it has priority usage of a jetty for clinker imports and cement exports with a dedicated hopper and conveyor for the transportation of clinker from the port to the plant.To meet the anticipated increase in cement demand, CMS Cement is developing a 1.0 million MT per annum grinding plant adjacent to the Mambong clinker plant. Construction of the new RM190.0 million plant began in 2014 and cement production is set to commence by the first half of 2016 (1H 2016). With this third plant in its stable, CMS Cement’s total production capacity will increase by almost 60%. This will enable CMS to meet growing cement demand in Sarawak, have significant reserve production capacity, as well as potentially extend our supply into nearby countries.8-1(larfarge)-1(tasek)=6OM Materials (Sarawak) Sdn. Bhd. (“OM Sarawak”) is the Group’s flagship smelter complex in Samalaju, Sarawak. Construction commenced in 2013, and first production was tapped in 2014. The plant consists of 8 main workshops, with two units of 25.5 MVA furnaces in each. Out of the 16 furnaces, 10 are allocated for the production of ferrosilicon, and 6 for the production of manganese alloys.Commissioned and built to anticipate the current paradigm shift in global ferroalloy production, OM Sarawak is a greenfield smelter located in the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy, Sarawak, Malaysia. Run on renewable hydro-power, it is in the centre of South East Asia and well sited along global trade routes. OM Sarawak will commission a sintering plant in 2019, widening its raw material procurement options by sintering on premises. The facility is expected to produce 250,000 metric tonnes of sinter ore per annum.Sintering is the process of heating and fusing powdered ore into higher grade, “semi-processed” ores. Smelting is the process of converting raw ores mined from the ground into alloys used in a variety of industrial applications.The plant has a production capacity of 200,000-210,000 metric tonnes per annum of ferrosilicon (FeSi), and 250,000-300,000 metric tonnes per annum of manganese alloys (see Products).OM Sarawak is a 75/25 joint venture between the Group and Cahya Mata Sarawak Berhad (CMSB), a listed industrial conglomerate on Bursa Malaysia.Malayan cement berhad3794VsHUME CEMENT INDUSTRIES BERHAD5000Cahya mata sarawak berhad2852Cima belongs to Uem group DenmarkSabah companyTop 3 players listed companies!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending. Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions. Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest. •••••••••••••••••••••••• 刷卡机的好处  付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。 保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。 无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。 •••••••••••••••••••••••• Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad  Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka. Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja. Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan. •••••••••••••••••••••••• Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628 Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwallets For more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6Q Visa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Carde-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPay With built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal 拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式） Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps: 1.

CS gave me a weird MCC of 5411, which did not make sense at all, because 5411 is for Grocery Stores. Perhaps, I might have heard wrongly, or the CS gave me wrong MCC. It should have been 5541 Service Stations ( with or without ancillary services), but I am unable to confirm. In short, my MCC information is not reliable.The general information I got from Maybank CS is that Maybank only retains the MCC, during the transaction date. Suppose that a customer calls Maybank CS a day after the transaction, Maybank system has supposedly purged the MCC, and Maybank CS is unable to retrieve the MCC. I am not sure whether this information from Maybank CS is accurate or not. Anyway, in general, it is far easier to retrieve the MCC, from Public Bank CS and Hong Leong CS, than Maybank CS.QUOTE(cybpsych @ Mar 2 2021, 12:05 PM)thanks for sharing the details.yes, MBB is very troublesome to retrieve the MCC.

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6QVisa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Carde-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPayWith built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式）Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps: 1.

Thus the middle-men can't monitor what you're doing or steal your credential. Only the VPN know where you actually going and the data that's being exchanged, and there are cases of VPN company that give the user logs to govt when requested.Even if you use VPN, you can still be misled to fake site as the website address is determined by DNS server, as explained below.DNS server is the phone book.

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6Q Visa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Card e-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPayWith built-in camera to accept various QR-Based paymentTouch screen display for multimedia useMore efficient, more environmentally friendlyDeal in just a few secondsWireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器提高工作效率、更环保短短几秒成交无线机（便携式）Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps:   1.

Pembayaran zakat ini akan memberi manfaat kepada golongan asnaf yang memerlukan di seluruh negara,” menurut TH.Urusniaga TH akan ditangguhkan sementara waktu bermula 8 malam, Selasa 2 Mac, 2021 sehingga 12 tengah hari, Rabu 3 Mac, 2021, bagi melancarkan urusan agihan keuntungan.TH menjelaskan para pendeposit boleh menyemak agihan keuntungan yang dikreditkan ke akaun masing-masing selepas 12 tengah hari Rabu 3 Mac, 2021 menerusi aplikasi THiJARI, kaunter TH, Bank Islam dan Bank Rakyat selain saluran elektronik bank rakan strategik TH iaitu Bank Islam, Bank Rakyat, Maybank dan CIMB.Mengenai perkembangan ibadah haji, Zulkifli berkata sehingga kini kerajaan Arab Saudi masih belum mengeluarkan kenyataan rasmi berkaitan musim haji 2021 walaupun telah menerima kira-kira 100,000 jemaah umrah sejak 1 Nov, 2020.“Walaupun masih belum mendapat pengesahan tentang ibadat haji tahun ini, kita perlu bersedia dengan segala kemungkinan.“Oleh itu saya menasihati semua bakal haji untuk mengikuti kursus asas haji mingguan yang sedang dianjurkan oleh TH secara dalam talian. Bakal-bakal haji juga perlu menjaga kesihatan diri dengan menjaga pemakanan dan lakukan senaman kerana ibadat haji menuntut kekuatan fizikal dan mental,” katanya.Beliau berkata ibadah haji telah ditangguhkan akibat pandemik yang melanda negara dan seluruh dunia justeru, beliau menyeru seluruh umat terus berdoa agar pandemik ini pulih sepenuhnya dan seterusnya dapat menjadi tetamu Allah di tanah suci.- Bernama",,,,,,,,,,,,

CS gave me a weird MCC of 5411, which did not make sense at all, because 5411 is for Grocery Stores. Perhaps, I might have heard wrongly, or the CS gave me wrong MCC. It should have been 5541 Service Stations ( with or without ancillary services), but I am unable to confirm. In short, my MCC information is not reliable.The general information I got from Maybank CS is that Maybank only retains the MCC, during the transaction date. Suppose that a customer calls Maybank CS a day after the transaction, Maybank system has supposedly purged the MCC, and Maybank CS is unable to retrieve the MCC. I am not sure whether this information from Maybank CS is accurate or not. Anyway, in general, it is far easier to retrieve the MCC, from Public Bank CS and Hong Leong CS, than Maybank CS.thanks for sharing the details.yes, MBB is very troublesome to retrieve the MCC. HLB, PBB, UOB can retrieve the MCC easily. SCB via livechat troublesome too.anyhow, just tried reload TNG Card at this Shell station using RHB-Shell card. once posted, will try to ask CS for MCC (getting thru CS via call is painful, normally will just leave my number for them to call back).",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6Q Visa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Card e-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPay With built-in camera to accept various QR-Based payment Touch screen display for multimedia use More efficient, more environmentally friendly Deal in just a few seconds Wireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal 拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码 用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器 提高工作效率、更环保 短短几秒成交 无线机（便携式） Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps: 1.

It should have been 5541 Service Stations ( with or without ancillary services), but I am unable to confirm. In short, my MCC information is not reliable.The general information I got from Maybank CS is that Maybank only retains the MCC, during the transaction date. Suppose that a customer calls Maybank CS a day after the transaction, Maybank system has supposedly purged the MCC, and Maybank CS is unable to retrieve the MCC. I am not sure whether this information from Maybank CS is accurate or not.

1019,lowyat,"Are telcos at a disadvantage with the 5G rollout?By GANESHWARAN KANATELCOSSaturday, 27 Feb 2021https://www.thestar.com.my/business/busines...-the-5g-rolloutHot race: With the 5G spectrum being a shared commodity, it seems likely that competition will intensify in the telecommunications industry.QUESTIONS are being raised on whether a government-led, single-entity rollout of the 5G network will put the private telecommunications companies (telcos) at a disadvantage.While the market is awaiting further details on how the recently announced government-owned special purpose vehicle (SPV) would deploy 5G, there are two sets of thoughts on the matter.On one hand, with the government being the sole owner of the 5G spectrum and infrastructure, telcos would not be burdened by the heavy upfront capital expenditure (capex) as compared to the 5G infrastructure being deployed individually.Unlike Malaysia, many countries have adopted the auction approach, which enables the government to allot 5G airwaves to the highest bidders.However, competitive auctions will lead to higher initial costs for telcos and cause cash-flow pressure.Malaysia’s SPV model could avert such issues and at the same time, create a level-playing field.On the flip side, there are concerns that Malaysia’s approach would affect telcos’ margins in the longer run due to extra costs.Earlier this week, Fitch Solutions warned that the SPV model would likely be costlier to implement as it would be centrally-coordinated.“Elevated costs associated with a single-entity rollout would likely be passed on to operators in the form of higher wholesale costs, and in turn, operators would find it difficult to extract higher margins from selling these services to their customers.“Lower profits would also mean less funds for operators to invest into service development, weakening the ability of the operators to differentiate themselves from their rivals, ” it says.Fitch Solutions points out further that value-added services will be key for operators to grow their 5G influence and provide more value to their customers beyond just faster speeds.Echoing a similar view, UOB Kay Hian Malaysia Research says telcos will need to focus on quality of service and products, considering there is no spectrum ownership by them.It adds that Maxis Bhd and Celcom, which is wholly-owned by Axiata Group Bhd, may potentially stand to lose their network superiority as the 5G network becomes a “shared commodity’’ under the SPV model.“Both telcos may have to look to innovate bundled products and engage actively with their customers to provide a good customer experience, ” it says.However, the research house notes that given the reduced upfront capex burden for telcos under the SPV model, it paves the way for “sustainable dividend yield for the likes of Digi.com Bhd”.It is noteworthy that telcos have spent 11% to 15% of their service revenue to roll out 3G nationwide and 13% to 16% of service revenue for 4G.Amid the concerns on the SPV approach to roll out 5G, TA Securities Research analyst Wilson Loo believes the single-entity model is “ideal” for the telecommunications sector.He says telcos will also be able to keep focused on efforts to meet the fixed and 4G mobile connectivity targets under the national digital infrastructure plan.“Telcos will avoid the heavy capex burden and cash-flow pressure involved in the 5G rollout if deployed individually (investments in 5G network are estimated to cost 25% to 75% more than that for 4G) while consumers will benefit from access to 5G services at competitive tariffs, ” says Loo.TA Securities Research has an “overweight” view on the telecommunications sector, with a “buy” call on Axiata, Maxis and Digi.Maybank IB Research analyst Tan Chi Wei says that by absolving telcos from the 5G-related capex via the SPV model, this would alleviate near-term pressure on returns.In addition, as the 5G deployment would likely boost demand for fibre, fixed-line players such as Telekom Malaysia Bhd and TIME Dotcom Bhd would benefit from the development.Nevertheless, the biggest risk for the 5G deployment would be on the ability of the SPV to execute as promised, according to Tan.“The SPV’s source of funds is presently unclear, with the regulator ruling out the use of USP funds, new taxes, and direct injection from government coffers.“In our view, fund raising through the capital market would require the SPV to be profit-oriented (which could lead to elevated access fees), which goes against the data inclusion and nation-building objectives behind this deployment model.“The regulator noted that further details would be revealed in due course, ” says Tan.The government has said that the SPV, which will be wholly-owned by the Finance Ministry, would be given the 700MHz, 3,500MHz and 28GHz spectrum to own, implement and manage the 5G infrastructure nationwide for 10 years.Operating via a wholesale model, telcos would be allowed to access the network, with rates and terms being regulated.In total, RM15bil would be invested over 10 years, with capex being front-loaded.5G services are targeted to be available selectively beginning end-2021.With the 5G spectrum being a shared commodity, it seems likely that competition will intensify in the telecommunications industry.While consumers would benefit from the competition in the form of attractively-priced 5G services, telcos’ margins may be affected.UOB Kay Hian Malaysia Research believes in the proliferation of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) or disruption from the likes of U-Mobile, Digi, RedTone or YES Communications.“We believe the likes of Digi and unlisted U-Mobile as well as YES Communications stand to benefit given their ‘late stage’ and ‘under-investment’ in the previous 3G/4G cycle.“We also do not discount the potential proliferation of MVNOs in Malaysia, ” it says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1051,lowyat,"Maybank expects loan loss provision to remain elevated, sets ROE FY21 target at 9%KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 25): Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), whose financial performance was dragged by higher impairments has guided that loan loss provisioning is expected to remain elevated given the continued impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and weak credit environment across its home markets.The Group's allowances for impairment losses on loans, advances, financing and other debts increased in its financial year ended 31 Dec 2020 (FY20) by RM2.3 billion or 101.0% to RM4.6 million compared with the previous corresponding financial year.AdvertisementThe group is targeting for its return on equity (ROE) to hover around 9% in financial year 2021 (FY21), slightly higher than the 8.1% recorded in FY20. Looking at past data, its net return on average shareholders equity ranged from 10% to 12% for the five-year period between FY2015 to FY2019.Maybank group president and chief executive officer, Datuk Abdul Farid Alias said today that economic recovery is expected to be gradual and uneven amid the pandemic containment measures such as the current Movement Control Order (MCO) which will impact business activity.“Last year the economic activities that opened accounted for 30%, while this year is about 60% of economic activity. So it’s still not 100%. Therefore like last year when we saw a slowdown in growth in the first half, we will probably see the same this year. And with limited mobility, some businesses will be affected,” Farid told a virtual briefing following the release of Maybank’s 4QFY20 results earlier.Loan growth is expected to gather momentum in line with economic recovery while net interest margins (NIM) should improve as deposits fully re-price, barring further interest rate cuts, said Abdul Farid, adding that Maybank expects the overnight policy rate to stay at 1.75% this year.Group gross loans for 2020 came in relatively flat at RM523 billion, however the group’s Malaysian operations was the only home market to register growth of 4% to RM326.7 billion, outpacing the industry growth of 3.4%.For FY21, Abdul Farid did not reveal Maybank’s forecast on loan growth, however he guided that it is expected to pick up this year subject to the country’s economic recovery.“Even with the MCO last year, we were able to grow mortgage loans by RM10 billion, auto financing grew by RM3 billion and SME also by RM3 billion. So we are quite hopeful to see better growth this year, but there are factors that will determine that,” he said.Dividend payout ratio at 91.2% for FY20The bank today said net profit for FY20 fell 21% year-on-year to RM6.48 billion from RM8.2 billion previously, as it was hit by higher net impairment losses during the year of RM5.07 billion compared with RM2.32 billion previously.Still, Maybank is rewarding shareholders with a 38.5 sen dividend per share, comprising an electable portion of 21 sen per share under its dividend reinvestment plan. Together with the interim dividend of 13.5 sen per share, the full-year dividend amounts to 52 sen per share, and translates into a full-year dividend payout ratio of 91.2%.The payout ratio of 91% is higher than the 87.8% it paid in FY19, which Abdul Farid said was due to the electable portion.“We have had this dividend reinvestment plan over the past few years in order for us to pay out more and give the option to the shareholders to elect whether they want to take cash or shares. Because of the ability to combine both, that’s why we have a higher dividend payout ratio. Assuming that every shareholder opts for shares, then our payout ratio would be around 39%.”We hope that shareholders will opt for shares because that will allow us to issue more and strengthen the capital base of the bank. The rationale being is that in the current volatile market place, the higher the capital, the higher the liquidity and the stronger the bank will be,” he said.Looking at the past five-year time frame from FY2020, Maybank’s dividend payout ratio was in the 70% range prior to FY2019’s 87.8%. It was 76.3% in FY2015, 78.1% in FY2016, 78.5% in FY2017 and 77.3% in FY20818.Shares of Maybank ended 20 sen or 2.53% higher at RM8.09, for a market capitalisation of RM92.34 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1061,lowyat,"QUOTE(squarepilot @ Feb 26 2021, 09:27 AM)Very high dividend rate for next 2 years at current price broAnyway, I ran a stimulation idea on buying Top Glove based on dividends. Yup. I sure did. What to do... batu api ma....   Anyway, let's be fair.... let's use that old simulation since DEC 2020 and I shall bookmark this thread and see what happens 2 years from now....This way, no matter what, we can learn.....Here .... post #41207I post the main part here again...................1. Buying a stock just b4 it goes ex dividend.Best one to TEST it out is Top Glove.Point is, you need to test such ideas/insinuations out. Recently Maybank, went ex-dividend. Look at Maybank now... it's been sliding since then. So you would have gotten the dividend but since the market readjusts the price for the dividend, the stock automatically trades lower.so test it out. Mark 6.70 as your buying price. Come back one month later. See the result.blah...blah....blah....anyway something like this .... just a rough idea.... run simulations...or maybe you have DUMBASS MAKE MONEY STOCK going to make its QR report in 2 weeks time. Run simulations. Assume you want to dive in early. And then compare it versus with the do nothing option. Examine the results....And also ... you can test out LOUSY IDEAS ... just don't care and test it out....   >>>>>>>>So the buy point 6.70 on Dec 2020.  Dividend collected so far 16..50Price today 5.30. :thumbsup:Edit. Put in another simulation. Buy TG at 5.30 for dividends....",,,,,,,,,,,,

1064,lowyat,"QUOTE(senzr @ Feb 23 2021, 11:09 AM)I am doing my research, and I am still learning.I want to try mining, as I have a decent gaming rig, and I'm interested in earning passive income with it.The reason why I am interested in crypto mining, is because I enjoy the technical pc building part of it.My interest is because of my pc hobby, not because I'm an investor.I take it as a hobby for now, but I am asking for advice.I would like to try mining first to earn crypto before I consider buying crypto with cash.I understand that there are a lot of restrictions for crypto in Malaysia.I understand that Luno is one of the exchanges/wallets that deals in MYR.So I would like to know:Which is the best wallet I can use with a mining program that I can then transfer to Luno and ultimately cash out in MYR?I get you, meng. Try minerstat.com and pool.binance.Minerstat does everything for you, download, configure, monitor your miners. It's free for 1 rig up to 16 gpus.Binance pool you can use without kyc, and it pays out daily with no minimum. Other pools takes weeks to reach min pay threshold, if you only have one old gpu, like me.After kyc you can explore binance. I've bought usdt, busd, xrp, ltc, like a 100 ravens. Tried p2p and got RM 50 in Maybank, no gas fees. All from slowly mining eth, haven't bought any coins with linggit. Now wasting money in pancakeswap. hahaAlso fun learning how to overclock and undervolt your gpu. Careful flashing bios.  The 3 DAXes recognized in Malayisa are luno, tokenize, and Sinegy. Sinegy was the easiest for me to get verified, and it has rm5 min withdrawl.But I haven't tried transferring eth or btc from Binance to Sinegy, coz fees are murder.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan. Menerima kad kredit dan debit memberikan perniagaan anda kelebihan berbanding mereka yang hanya menerima tunai sahaja.Transaksi Tanpa TunaiPada masa kini, ramai orang tidak suka membawa wang tunai yang banyak kerana ia menyusahkan dan boleh menjadi ancaman pada keselamatan mereka. Oleh itu, kebanyakan orang mempunyai kad kredit dan debit yang melepaskan mereka daripada bahaya dan kesulitan tersebut. Kemudahan itu juga memberi jaminan bahawa mereka akan sentiasa mempunyai wang yang mencukupi untuk membayar barangan yang mereka mahukan.••••••••••••••••••••••••Hotline Number: 011-2629 0628 [Cyndee]WhatsApp:https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=601126290628Website:https://www.creditcardmachine.my/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MerchantPaymentSol...itDebitEwalletsFor more videos, please visit our Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP4glEoIqbZZVT6wWd0Ez6Q Visa/Master - Credit Card & Debit Card e-wallets - UnionPay QR, Alipay, Wechat Pay, Touch n Go, Maybank QRPay, Boost Pay, GrabPay, RazerPay With built-in camera to accept various QR-Based payment Touch screen display for multimedia use More efficient, more environmentally friendly Deal in just a few seconds Wireless (Portable GPRS) Terminal 拥有照相功能，快速扫描电子钱包、二维码 用于触摸屏的多媒体显示器 提高工作效率、更环保 短短几秒成交 无线机（便携式） Get your All-In-One Digital Payment Latest Touchscreen Terminal (card + e-wallets acceptances) in just 5 steps: 1.

1194,lowyat,"Malaysian private equity firm Creador, which is hitting the road to raise up to $650 million for its fifth vehicle, is also preparing its exit pipeline for 2021, according to founder and CEO Brahmal Vasudevan.Creador, which has closed two big vehicles in the last five years, hopes to divest its more than five-year-old stakes in Malaysian credit reporting agency CTOS Holdings and Indonesian lender Bank Index.""We have the CTOS IPO coming up in Malaysia around July. We have appointed investment banks and are currently working out details,"" he said, declining to elaborate.Malaysian credit reporting agency CTOS, which has roped in RHB Investment Bank, Maybank Investment Bank and Credit Suisse as advisers, is reportedly seeking to raise about $150 million from its IPO.Creador bought a 70% stake in CTOS Holdings for 215 million ringgit ($53 million) in September 2014 through its second fund. The private equity fund currently owns an 80% stake in CTOS and is looking to sell at least a 25% stake, DealStreetAsia reported in August last year.Creador is also looking to sell off its nearly six-year-old investment in the Indonesian lender Bank Index. ""We are also exiting Bank Index,"" Vasudevan said. He said Creador plans to sell its stake back to the [promoter] family.Creador had, through its second fund, invested 290 billion rupiah ($210 million) for a 20% stake in Bank Index, which operates over 40 branches in Indonesia's tier-1 and tier-2 cities.Bank Index is majority-owned by the Setiawan family, whose business interests include financial services, sugar refining and flour milling, and property, according to Singapore-based SBI Venture Capital, another shareholder in the bank. As of September 2019, Bank Index's loans and deposit portfolio stood at $490 million and $505 million respectively.Creador secured a partial exit in October last year through the listing of its retail portfolio Mr D.I.Y. Group, which raised 1.5 billion ringgit in Malaysia's biggest IPO in the last three years.For the upcoming fifth fund that Creador plans to launch in March, the firm plans to focus on roping in its existing LP base to meet the target.""We're going to focus mainly on our existing LP, making sure that their demands are satisfied. We have been approached by several new investors. But it's something we have to manage and see if we can cope,"" he said.The proposed fund is larger than its previous fund, which closed in July 2019 at $565 million, exceeding the target of $550 million.While the broad strategy for the fifth fund will be similar to its predecessors, Creador may scout for more deal opportunities in Thailand.""The geographic focus is going to be the same. We cover India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines. We may see a little more [investment] in Thailand this time. We are exploring the market,"" Vasudevan said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Though I was stressing IB being not licensed here in Malaysia, I guess she knows and she said ""As we are the receiver, this is no problem. The problem is when the amount is too large, BNM may ask us to verify with our client where the money is from"". She also said, ""BNM keeps changing regulations, so things are very gray""I asked what is a ""large"" amount. is rm50k considered large? She said rm50k is not large (Cis,   ) large is 6-7 figures. I also asked, why do I hear people complain about their transactions being blocked for sending money abroad (such as, to IB).She said the amount may have been too large, especially if it's over the counter and the bank wants documents for why the money is being transferred.She added, ideally sending out money online for overseas investment should not be a problem but receiving money from overseas has fewer restrictions than sending money overseas.So I think I'm gonna give it a go, open a business account and start transferring monthly gains as income. I have all the records (salary/tax) for my initial capital (the money was already there in the first place) and all I'm doing is investing in stocks.Lastly, this is a great thread, 160 pages - Ive gone through first 60, still have another 100   . erizdagreat moosset ramjade dwRKthanks for the info guysBut I yet to find anyone who mentioned any issues on transferring money back to Malaysia directly from IB. (only problems transfer to IB)Do you guys have any experience (blocked transaction or flagged by BNM) issues transferring money back directly from IB? What is the biggest amount you have transferred back so far and what type of questions bank will ask?These are some posts that had tried direct withdrawal to Malaysia MYR account. But yeah as you pointed out just have to check on the taxes to be sure everything is within limits/legality (since it's a registered business recognising profits etc)» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «QUOTE(erizdagreat @ Jan 1 2021, 09:37 AM)If you withdraw using your free monthly withdrawal, then there are no other charges. If your Maybank account is in MYR, Maybank will automatically convert the USD amount to MYR using their rates. This conversion is slightly less favourable than spot rate. The whole process from initiating withdrawal to having the amount in your account takes around 12 hours or shorter.BTW, This is the only withdrawal method I useQUOTE(AntzJ @ Feb 9 2021, 01:45 PM)Thanks to all the sifus here, managed successfully to open account with:Interactive Broker  (Pure)E*TradeTransferwiseInstaremMaybank SGand after 6 months successful trading in the US and my first IB withdrawal today,here is my sharing,it was direct IB US to MBB MY,sent out USD 500 yesterday and received MYR 1961.03<a href='https://pictr.com/images/2021/02/09/7vqwMY.jpg' target='_blank'>https://pictr.com/images/2021/02/09/7vqwMY.jpg </a>https://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopi...post&p=99951135",,,,,,,,,,,,

If the declined charge is higher than this amount, ask your credit card company to increase the limitYour card reached the maximum number of charges allowed in a period:Check how many times your card can be charged in the given time period. If you reached this amount, ask your bank to increase the limit, wait until your card can be charged again, or make a payment with a different payment method.Your card doesn't accept charges from an online sourceMake sure your card allows online transactions. If it doesn't, talk to your credit card company about allowing these charges. Or use another cardYour card doesn't allow international transactionsIf you're making payments from abroad, make sure your card accepts international charges.

If not, carefully check the card number when filling out the form.Billing addressMake sure that the billing address you use for the transaction matches those that your credit card company has.

It's only illegal from IB side if US banned Malaysian from trading on US market. Otherwise IB couldn't care if it's illegal from Malaysia side because 1) they never have license from SC to operate in Malaysia anyway hence they are not bound by Malaysian law QUOTE2. In the same lowyat post - the post owner said he can't do the transfer using Maybank but can using CIMB. Another person who replied said he used Maybank FCA to transfer funds. this is confusingIt's the bank who dont want any problem hence easier for them to just block you.QUOTE3. So from your SG bank, you guys direct them back to your Malaysia bank for personal use?Can. But not recommended to use banks cause very expensive. You get less money (higher exchange rates by banks)QUOTE4. The broker is not illegal but just not recognized in Malaysia by SC (I've read a similar post regarding Etoro) - so what would be the risk here? Can your bank account be frozen? or only transaction blocks?They just block your Transaction and block access to IB site QUOTEI see people post, if the bank block from IBKR, just use Transferwise or Instarem (now it's possible to transfer MYR to USD directly using transferwise borderless acct - I have linked it but yet to do a transfer) - how is this method of transaction legal then?

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 😍付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad 😍Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan.

All of which had deadlines (all of which have passed except for Android 11, which now requires Devs to support it by November 1, 2021). Developers can choose to set the minSdkVersion to support even Android 5.1 if they choose to. Don't believe me? This is the quote that shows up in every blog post for every single version of Android as it comes out.https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2...target-api.htmlYou can't get ""hacked"" and lose funds. That's not how banking works. If they have that kind of access to your phone, they don't even need to hijack the app in the first place.

1374,lowyat,"Hi recently i just open new maybank account during registration the staff recommended me to choose for maybank 2u savers instead of basic saving account but since its my first time with maybank i prefer basic for a start, i do ask her later what if i want to change to maybank 2u, she said i need to terminate the basic sv account then can proceed for m2u.  After finish registration she point me to atm / cash deposit to put rm 20 the minimum amount for basic sv account, when done then i told to go to financial advisor section and here are some confusion happen.1. The guy for financial advisor look at the resit atm rm 20 and then he said i was suppose to deposit rm 250 which minimum amount for  M2u savers account, so i mention to him is basic sv but somehow he insist i need to as if it was a mandatory to open m2u. So we went to see the lady staff that help me with the registration for basic sv to confirm is basic sv that i was registered for.2. Then went back to financial advisor desk , he then told me to download maybank app, while downloading he give me his ipad to do the app registration and set up 6 pin digit numbers. Refering to the yellow reference card the are 2 account, 1. Which i believe is for basic and 2. The numbers similar to number on debit card. He told me to kick in numbers from account 2. Complete the app registration was on his ipad ( how safe is this i wonder ).Now my question is what is account 1and 2 ? Does debit card for basic sv has a debit advice rm 8 fee also since i notice the deduct.Am i missing some crucial info on the matter during the whole process ?

They will say that someone may have used your ic for loan or that you have a case against you.I called 2 times using different numbers and both times their story was different..I just called them to play along as i knew it was a scam all along because i called maybank and i verified i did not have any issues with my banking facilities.Be careful as they are very smooth and convincing.Just always use logic.. Legal issues will never be corresponded by SMS and you will not be asked to call mobile numbers.Anyway, here is the list of this group - they work as a team.

Yes, I've called Maybank, and have had all restrictions removed.Now, here comes the weird part. For every transaction that was declined, Maybank puts 2 pre-authorization holds. So, for example, if I purchase something a game for $10, card gets declined, transaction fails, and i get 2 pre-authorization holds totalling $20.To make matters worst, STEAM support says no purchase has been made, thus there is no transaction number.  The bank says that the transaction was not declined, and thus I should contact STEAM.  f*** ME RIGHT?This has happened 12 times since May 2014. The first 6 transaction made in May was finally refunded in July (2 bloody months).  My other transactions made in August are still on pre-authorization hold, and I'm still waiting for maybank (f*** them) to get it sorted.At the same time, due to the fact that this issue also happened when I tried making purchases from Humble Bundle suggests that the issue lies within Maybank itself.I would advise everyone who has used Maybank's debit card to purchase, regardless to which merchant, and has their card declined, to bloody make sure that they have refunded your pre-authorization holds.edit: some words",,,,,,,,,,,,

1524,lowyat,"[u]This morning, I was served and treated badly at this branch so I wrote a complaint to thier customer service. I hope it works.This is my letter:[u]Maybank Customer Service,RE: Rude Banker at Taman Connaught BranchGood day!I regret to make a complaint to you regarding the unsatisfactory service I received at your Taman Connaught branch on 7/1/2014, this morning.I used to fill in a cash deposit slip myself but the receptionist told me that I could just take the number and go straight to the counter. I guessed you have changed the system so I was not bothered.When it was my turn, I was served by this tall and thin middle-aged lady with curly hair and glasses. She did not wear Maybank uniform but clothes of similar colour so I guessed she was of a higher position. I told her than I want to remit RM65 as soon as I got to the counter and she said nothing. When I gave her RM100 and the number slip, she looked ""shocked"" and asked why did I not fill in the cash deposit slip. I was the one who should be shocked and I told her what I heard from the receptionist. Then her colleague pass her a blank piece of paper and she asked me to write down the account number. I did so. Up until this point, I felt extremely uncomfortable with her way of speaking and her expression but I did not want to make a fuss on it.When she gave me the receipt, I saw she had remitted RM100. I immediately informed her and she started to display an annoyed, worked-up attitude and reproached me that I did not write down the amount on that piece of paper. When her colleague asked the same thing she answered loudly and sternly that I DID NOT. However, I was just following her instruction which she mentioned only the account number; and that piece of paper had not a word of instruction. There was no changes in her behaviour. She kept reproaching me that I should write clear information. When she returned the changes (RM35) to me, she threw the notes on the counter. I felt greatly HUMILIATED. Still, I remained POLITE to the very last minute and uttered a ""thank you"", then I left.I returned to my university (UCSI university) and talked to my classmates, just for the sake of venting. However, it surprised me that two of my classmates had the same experience. They had also some slight problems with their transactions and they experienced rudeness from this lady-- as if we deserved it. This made me believe that there must be some other students on campus (or anyone else) besides me who had been served rudely. Therefore, I was compelled to write this letter.It is sad to see that there is such a rude worker in a big professional company like Maybank. Moreover, this branch is situated outside UCSI University; they are dealing with foreign students from many different countries. It is a shame if there were any foreigner being treated rudely and it might leave a bad taste in their mouth.It would be very much appreciated if you will look into this matter with great concern. For more detailed information, I was at counter 4 between 9.30am and 10am. I hope that someone will take appropriate action and advise that lady on this issue.Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And if these loss is extrapolated, Maybank could be looking at a potential loss of RM1.74 billion,” Pua told a press conference today.He also said that Maybank was “staring at a staggering paper losses of RM2.5 billion” as a result of the acquisition, namely when BII shares closed at Rp315 or 30.7% drop from the acquisition price as of last week.In 2008, Maybank acquired BII at the cost of RM8.25 billion at approximately Rp455 per share and was flayed by critics for paying more than four times the asset value of BII.“In reality, as at Dec 31, 2012, Maybank has already made impairments of RM1.62 billion for the acquisition. This is from Maybank records itself,” he said.He noted that since the acquisition, the return on Maybank’s investment has been abysmal at -0.17%, 1.86%, 2.31% and 6.27% in 2009, 2013, 2011 and 2012 respectively.“Despite the above, in the announcement to Bursa Malaysia, Maybank has claimed that ‘the disposal will not result in any material financial impact to the group’,” Pua said.“However, evidence points to the contrary and in the light of billions of ringgit of losses incurred by Maybank… it is crucial now for Maybank to come clean,” he added, referring particularly to the disposal of 9% of shares.He then explained that Maybank was under pressure to sell its stake in BII due to the Indonesian stock market regulation which requires that at least 20% of BII’s shares to be “free float”.“This condition was imposed by the Indonesian authorities and accepted by Maybank when BII was acquired in 2008,” he said.“More losses will likely be realised when Maybank is forced to sell another 8.3% of BII shares to third parties by Dec 31, 2013, the new extended deadline granted,” he added.‘Good for the country’Pua then urged Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak, who is also Finance Minister, to “personally look into this matter”.“We call upon (Najib) to personally look into the matter, whether the cause of losses was ‘a bad business decision’ or possibly a reckless abuse of power,” he said.“Whichever the cause, action must be taken against those found at fault so that the rakyat’s interest in Maybank Bhd will continue to be protected.”In 2008, then prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi defended the acquisition claiming that “the government is confident that the management of Maybank and its board of directors have made the purchase not only in the best interest of Maybank but also for the country”.Najib had insisted then that the “move was still a good one for the country”.In 2012, Maybank chairman Megat Zaharuddin Megat Mohd Nor told Reuters that Maybank is “not going to sell down if we’re going to make a loss compared to what we thought it should be”.Zaharuddin, who is also BII’s president commissioner, said the bank will not sell BII’s stake below Rp510 per share, the price it paid to buy the bank in 2008 before discount.http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/...ii-acquisition/It seems like a bad decision by maybank and this was supported by our PM.There is also a lot of problem with online banking.Their m2u seems to be going down or lagging more often nowdays.

My aunt said that she received a letter from Maybank that states my mom has an outstanding amount of RM 37,000. Something regarding house installment. And the letter says my mom has to pay that amount within 14 days. But the thing is, my mom does not have a Maybank account. She only holds a Hong Leong bank account. Besides that, my mom is a divorcee, full-time housewife, unemployed. My family's finances all come from my father. My mom has no any other property besides her current car and our current house which is in KL. The weirdest thing is, we don't understand why the letter was sent to my aunt's house address. We used to stay in Seremban, but that was like 15 years ago. What more, the place we used to stay last time in Seremban is not near to my aunt's place. Please, believe me, we don't even know what's going on. I will upload the pictures of the letter once I got it on hand from my aunt. I swear on my life my mom NEVER applied any loans. Please tell me what should I do?",,,,,,,,,,,,

1601,lowyat,"who wants a part of my RM42 million? i'm feeling generous today  QUOTEFrom:AHMED BIN MUHAMMADMalayan Banking BerhadLevel 14, Menara Maybank100 Jalan Tun Perak50050 Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.SWIFT Code :- MBBEMYKL(.maybank2u.com.my) Good Day, I am an investment consultant working with MayBank Kuala Lumpur Malaysia at their offshore department. I will be happy to work this deal out with you if you have a corporate or personal Bank Account and if you are capable to keep TOP SECRET. I need strong Assurance that you will never let me down, if I transfer this money to your account. During one of our periodic auditing I discovered a dormant accounts with holding balance of US $42,759,000.00 {Forty Two Million seven hundred an fifty Nine Thousand US Dollars only} Sometimes a person will open a bank account, deposit money, and then disappear into the tin air. Banks are not always able to find out what has become of these silent customers, or to know whether they should follow up on requests from people who claim to be heirs to the accounts. The main problem is that the customer resides abroad and, due to bank secrecy, the bank cannot publish notices in the international press to locate the depositories  This has led the majority of banks to refrain from opening small-deposit accounts for foreign customers; for fear that they will forget that the account exists. It has happened in the past, however, that customers pass away and their heirs can neither prove the death, nor their heir ship. This was a frequent occurrence during the wartime periods, and the banks have now set up a simple, rapid resolution procedure operating to their customers' advantage. Dormant assets are defined as any assets deposited with a bank (i.e. an account, a custody account or a safety-deposit box) for which there has been no contact with the customer in the bank's files for the last ten years or more. I am constrained to issue more details about this business until your response is received. If you know that you are capable to handle large or small amount on trust and can keep secret and ready to take 45% of any amount I transfer to your account from the dormant account and I will take 55%, send your account information's by return mail. Tell me more about yourself, while I look forward to receive the above information. I want to re-assure you that this business is risk free and you can send an empty account to receive the funds, provided that the account is capable to receive incoming funds. Look forward to discuss this opportunity further with you in detail. Please email me back on this mail address:  ([email protected]) and provide me with your phone number for discussion of this transaction in further details. Thank you for your time and attention.Regards,AHMED BIN MUHAMMAD",,,,,,,,,,,,

1603,lowyat,"Okay, let me declare the earlier story first.Yesterday morning I went Maybank to open a saving account. I wasn't a Maybank user but a CIMB card holder. I was told that recently once you've create an account, you'll have a VISA debit card as well and MSOS will be automatically activated.When I've done everything, I went home and tried to do some online transaction. I added some funds to my Steam Wallet, around RM180 converted and satu kali spent all of funds n a night. Everything was fine and I felt quite satisfied.And then the next morning, I was trying to add some funds again. But I tried several times and steam showed me ""An unexpected error has occurred. Your purchase has not been completed."" So just now one hour ago, I hooked up Maybank Customer Call service, don't know how to officially name it -.-And then 25 minutes of toot-toot finally someone picked up and answered my waiting. I explained everything to her and she told me that I didn't not activate MSOS which is why I was unable to proceed the transaction, I asked her twice about Macam Mana last night I boleh guna untuk beli barang?! She just said nevermind, I'll help you to activate and double confirm your phone number, you'll receive a message soon (Until now I still have not received any message pun) That was around 2:34 according to my computer time, I tried to add funds steam wallet while on the phone call with customer service at the same time, also cannot successful as well, she told me you'll need to wait for a moment amd during 12-1am and 3-4am you'll not be able to do any transaction online.  Guess I need to wait for the next morning to check already. I tak tau. Feel like kena main. Luckily it's not urgent.

1616,lowyat,"As per last topic mentioned, Maybank launched it newly plan known as Luxury Edition, a single premium closed-ended investment fund insurance plan with capital guaranteed by Maybank Berhad. Let read the information given by news as below,KUALA LUMPUR: To tap into potential of the luxury goods market, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) has launched Luxury Edition, a single premium closed-ended investment-linked insurance plan in Malaysia.Maybank Luxury Edition offers a combination of insurance protection and investment for potentially higher returns, all within one single plan. It is the first such investment-linked plan in Malaysia which is tied to the luxury market.The largest financial group in the country targets to achieve its cap of RM275 million in sales by the time the fund closes on 7 May 2013.Luxury Edition is a 3-year single premium closed-ended investment-linked insurance plan that invests part of the collected premium in an option linked to a basket of six stocks within the luxury theme listed at various stock exchanges. The plan is tailored with potentially higher returns riding on the constant rise of the luxury goods market.Maybank deputy president & head of community financial services, Datuk Lim Hong Tat said this new plan was designed to meet the increasing demand for attractive investment products that will fit the varying risk profiles of customer segments.“Luxury Edition is capital guaranteed and has a number of other attractive features that will interest customers who believe in the growth potential of the luxury market,” he said in statement today.Datuk Lim added that based on research, the luxury market has outgrown global GDP by more than two-fold over the last 10 years and this trend is expected to continue.“In fact, growth statistics from emerging markets has clearly shown the increasing prominence of luxury spending in these markets,” he explained. “This positive growth has given us the opportunity to tap into the affluent market providing our customers with an insurance plan which offers exclusive advantages,” he said.Datuk Lim also said that emerging markets are expected to make up over 70% of the global luxury goods market size by the year 2020, with growth expected to be driven by countries such as Macau, China and Russia.“All these factors highlight Luxury Edition's unique features which we believe will drive demand for this new investment plan. It is risk-free as customers could enjoy potentially higher investment gains apart from the capital guarantee, while being protected at the same time,” he said.The Luxury Edition plan, underwritten by Etiqa, requires a minimum investment of RM15,000, with additional investments in multiples of RM1,000.With a short tenure of three years, the plan offers a potential gross cash payout of 8% at the end of the second and third policy year. Apart from the cash payout, the plan offers 100% capital back, 10% of the Single Premium at the end of the first policy year and the remaining 90% at maturity while giving customers life coverage of up to 130% of the capital during investment period.Info,http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?f...34&sec=businessA short definition is Luxury Definition is a 3 year single premium investment linked plan that invest in luxury market with possibility to earn 8% per annum with minimum investment amount $15,000 and in multiple of $1,000 for additional.Advantages# Capital is guaranteed 100% by Maybank, 10% of the capital will be return on 1st year while 90% of the investment amount will be gain at end of the 3th year tenure.# A chance or possibility but not guaranteed in 8% payout at the 2nd and 3rd year.# Short tenure because it only take three years.# Life insurance protection with subject to minimum 105% of single premium to maximum 130% # Diversification of portfolio# Assuming the portfolio does return 8% from stock invesment, the total of three year average return will be at 4.53% per year.Disadvantages# Imposed 3.30% sales charge which already included 1.1% commission, assuming invested $100,000 into this plan, $3,300 will be charge as sales imposed and leave your investment amount at $96,700.# Fund management charge maximum 0.30 per annum from the current date for Net Asset Value (NAV)# Investment return is not guaranteed and subject to the return from luxury investment stocks.# Return from the investment is not guaranteed and promise in the form of re-invest, it could be given in cash form only.# Investment tax 8% of any return given on 2nd and 3rd year.From my personal opinion, we heard that Amanah Hartanah Bumiputera is managed by Maybank Asset Management. However for this case, maybank still keep their fees,charge and return if portfolio not making 8% of the interest by using public investor asset. By using our money to invest and expect a 8% return, It still not a good investment for me. but probably maybe good for you?Info,http://www.maybank2u.com.my/WebBank/LE080313_brochure.pdfhttp://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v7/bu/ne...s.php?id=940706http://www.etiqa.com.my/Malay/Pages/LuxuryEdition.aspx",,,,,,,,,,,,

The details are as below:Maybank - MaxiHome-iRate (Original): BLR-2.1% (No lock in period)Rate (Appeal): 1st year BLR-2.5%, 2nd and 3rd year BLR -2.45%, thereafter BLR -2.4%. Base on thereafter rate BLR -2.4%Margin: 90%Tenure: 40 yrsOther Benefits:1. No lock in period (can sell, settle or refinance any time)2. Selling price (Maximum BLR up to 10.6% only. If BLR going up above 10.6% will only capped on max 10.6% only.)3. Amount extra you paid will direct reduce the loan amount without giving the bank notice, processing fees for each withdrawal is RM25 only.4. Free standing instruction (monthly auto debit from your existing acc)OCBCRate (Original): BLR-2.4% (No lock in period)Rate (Appeal): BLR-2.45% (3yrs lock in period)Margin: 90%Tenure: 38 yrsOther Benefits:1. Renovation and refurbishment LoanRenovation loan can be a contingency loan for you upon vacant possession. You are allowed to use this backup loan to renovate your house before you sell. This is exclusive for our OCBC customer, only to those who is eligible to get it. There are personal contingency and renovation loan package involved. You can use this personal contingency for another investment without taking a huge amount from your saving or you can use the renovation loan to renovate in order you can sell for higher price. If you use it, interest only will charge, if you don’t use it, you may just leave it for one year after you get the key, it will automatically lapse and no interests charge. Let’s say, if you are eligible to get 200k from renovation and personal contingency, yet you use only 50k out of this 200k, the interest will only charges based on 50k but not 200k. You can flexibly use this loan to do further investment, or even if you don’t, there is no harm to you, it would be a good offer for investor. The interest is only BLR + 0%. 2. PortabilityBesides, portability enables investor to go for second property by selling off the property with OCBC in order to enjoy waived of stamp duties. If you current property loan amount is 700k, 0.5 tax by government which we called stamp duties, may costs roughly 3.5k. What if customers choose to get from OCBC and the second property goes for OCBC again, the 3.5k can be waived, you can save more in future. Either your existing housing loan with OCBC is RM 500k, RM 200k has been settled through instalment, your second loan with OCBC again, RM 200k stamp duty can be waived by top up your loan on the existing, RM 1k roughly can be waived. 3. Top up LoanCustomer is able to top up his loan upon vacant possession, bank will according to the market value to top up for you. This top up loan will not be charges or legal fees and disbursement. Therefore, there is another saver plan for OCBC users.Other than that, the result announcement will be within 3 days. If customer profile is within guideline, we can get back to our customer in within 3 days. Any question or inquiry please do not hesitate to look for me, I will be here to serve you up. Million thanks. 4. Capital Repayment We do not have to pay for RM 200 to start an account, and no monthly services charge for RM 10. In addition, we do allow our customer to put in extra money to direct offset principal and withdraw it any time. Each withdrawal only RM 10 charge, it is good if customer does not withdraw often or more than 12 times per annum.Really appreciate if anyone can advice me which one is a better offer. Thanks!

This step-up plan is on offer until the 15th March 2012.The step-up plan is basically a 9 year 90% loan with 3.5% flat per-annum interest which starts you off with a lower than usual monthly repayment, which then increases to a higher amount from the 3rd year onwards, and then up again during the 7th, 8th, and 9th years.Here’s a sample of the repayment amounts:One caveat though – Sagas purchased under the step up financing scheme will only have a 3 year manufacturer warranty instead of the 5 year Extended Warranty Programme that Proton Sagas usually come with if you opt for standard financing.Might be tempting – but 9 year loans should be treated as a last resort if you want to buy a car.http://paultan.org/2012/02/22/proton-offer...or-proton-saga/",,,,,,,,,,,,

At first I thought that hey, it could be that the intersest is calculated based on overal principal, and we pay higher interest for the first few years and it will slowly decrease over the years. It's is brilliant part of Maybank to use this, as for those who think they want to settle the loan earlier will have lotsa principal to pay.

We are at an advantage here as we have the infrastructure and network.“We want to have a coordinated effort to tap the mass affluent market and have agreed to give our full commitment to develop this.“On the IB side, we will have the products in place so that once the wealth managers operate across the region under a single platform, they can cater to the demands of customers,” he said.The team had the idea of supporting the wealth management business at one time but it lacked the capabilities to do so then.“Now that we have the capabilities, we are studying how to drive the business.“We are looking at Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia the home markets,” he added.» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «The wealth management under Maybank/Kim Eng is especially strong in Singapore and Thailand.In Malaysia, it is under the commercial bank on the private banking side.“In wealth management, you need new products. What we have done so far is to introduce new products.“We have recently launched warrants which were under our equity derivatives.“We are applying for futures licence and in the process of launching futures products,” said Zafrul.“With Kim Eng into asset management, we can also offer related products to our clients.“Maybank has the database but we need to cross sell with what Kim Eng has and what is offered in the region.“Right now, wealth management for us is just stockbroking and unit trusts, we are selling mainly third party products,” he added.The Maybank/Kim Eng group targets to grow its regional asset management business from S$2bil currently to S$20bil by 2015.Via its US$1.5bil purchase of Kim Eng, Maybank has increased its presence in the investment banking scenes of 10 countries in Asia. http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?f...46&sec=business",,,,,,,,,,,,

There is enough momentum going ahead in Singapore and Indonesia to continue to drive our growth as well.""However, taking into account the external environment, ""we remain cautiously optimistic about the future,"" he said.Asked on more takeover moves in the financial year, Wahid said the focus would be through the organic growth.""The target we have set is based on organic activities for the next financial year but we don't discount if there are opportunities that come to us that makes senses.""Maybank completes the RM4.692 billion acquisition of Singapore's brokerage firm, Kim Eng Holdings, this month, making it one of top five brokerages in Southeast Asia.Therefore, the board has proposed a final dividend under the dividend reinvestment plan of 32 sen per share less 25 per cent income tax.""We are able to pay a bit more (than the group dividend payout policy) and we want to maintain it,"" its president and chief executive officer Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar said.Out of the amount four sen per share will be paid in cash while the balance of 28 sen per share will be in the electable portion whereby a shareholder may either elect to receive it fully in cash or reinvest it in Maybank shares.This brings the total dividend for the year to 60 sen per share, representing a total payout ratio of 74.9 per cent for the year, surpassing the group dividend payout policy of 40 per cent to 60 per cent.The dividend is expected to be distributed in October.Asked whether such a record result was sustainable, Abdul Wahid said that projects activities from the economic transformation program (ETP) would help to sustain the group strong performance.""With our current assessment, we believe that there is enough impetus from various ETP projects taking drive domestic growth in Malaysia.

It wants more momentum in that area since it’s strong on the investment side.“In the case of Maybank, if the acquisition involves taking over RHB’s brokerage arm and securities, it will boost its investment banking side.”Sector consolidation will also be in line with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak’s initiative to create regional banking champions as part of the government’s plan to increase investment in Malaysia and move the country up the value chain.Maybank recently bought Singapore’s Kim Eng Securities, which has one of the largest stockbroking operations in Southeast Asia, to plug a hole in its regional investment banking business.“The potential transaction . . . would be consistent with Maybank’s vision to become a regional financial services leader and support its strategic objectives of being the No. 1 retail financial services provider in Malaysia,” Maybank said.Malaysia’s neighbour to the south, Singapore, also saw a wave of bank mergers in the early 2000s, sparked by government’s view that the city state had too many banks.After the consolidation, the island nation allowed foreign banks to increase their presence in Singapore. Now Singapore has three domestic banks while Malaysia has 10.A takeover of RHB by Maybank would make the biggest banking group in Southeast Asia by market value, exceeding Singapore’s DBS. A CIMB-RHB combination would rank just below DBS.EPF holds trump cardBank Negara, the country’s central bank, told Maybank and CIMB today that it had no objections in principle to them merging with RHB, according to separate statements from the lenders.An official at RHB told Reuters it had yet to receive a formal notice from either Maybank or CIMB.The two banking groups have been linked to a possible takeover of RHB since shareholder Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank put its 25 per cent stake up for sale last March.Buyers of RHB, Malaysia’s fifth-biggest bank, would have to talk to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), a state pension fund for non-government employees, which holds a 45 per cent stake.If the EPF decides to sell its stake to Maybank or CIMB, this would trigger a general offer for the rest of the shares.“The EPF does not have a very strong case why it should own such a large stake in a bank, when it should typically be passive investors,” said Pong Teng Siew, the head of research for Jupiter Securities.EPF has promised to trim its stake in RHB, but has so far not sold any significant blocks.Maybank and CIMB have received permission from the central bank to hold negotiations for three months starting May 31.CIMB, which earlier this month denied that it wanted to enter the auction to buy a stake in RHB, said today that a deal to combine with RHB would create value.“We believe that it is incumbent on us to engage on this opportunity to put forward a value-creating merger between the two banks and support the national banking consolidation agenda,” said CEO Nazir Razak.The latest development complicates ADCB’s sale of its stake. Its board was meeting today to pick a shortlist for second-round bidders, sources with knowledge of the deal said.ADCB’s auction of its stake in RHB drew international interest as the purchase would provide immediate exposure to a fast-growing banking sector in an economy expected to expand by 5-6 per cent in 2011.Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and private equity firms Carlyle and JC Flowers were among first-round bidders, sources told Reuters earlier this month.Faced with an ageing population and a chronically weak economy at home, Japan’s largest banks are keen to expand into faster-growing markets overseas. — ReutersWhat do you think whether the move by Maybank and CIMB is beneficial to rakyat, or just enriching themselves. Please discuss. Added on June 2, 2011, 12:24 amI do personally feel like the merger (or should we say acquisition) of cimb-rhb or maybank-rhb would just enrich the shareholders itself. Correct me if I'm wrong but the employees of rhb will suffer most since there will be issues of retrenchment due to several issues like overlapping responsibilities, etc. Your points is appreciated.

1927,lowyat,"PETALING JAYA: Let the fight begin. In what is set to become the biggest takeover battle in Malaysia's corporate history, banking heavyweights Malayan Banking Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd have declared their interest to wrest control of RHB Capital Bhd, which could cost over RM20bil.Paving the way for this fight, Bank Negara yesterday gave the nod to both banking groups to separately commence talks with RHB Capital and its substantial shareholders for a possible merger of the businesses of the two banking groups. This was announced by Maybank and CIMB in separate announcements to Bursa Malaysia yesterday. The approval to commence negotiations is valid for three months from Bank Negara's letter dated May 31, 2011.“We believe that it is incumbent on us to engage on this opportunity to put forward a value-creating merger between the two banks and support the national banking consolidation agenda,” said CIMB's group chief executive Datuk Seri Nazir Razak in a statement.“It is, however, very early days as negotiations have not even commenced. Our stakeholders know of our track record in this area and we seek their indulgence over the next few weeks and possibly more, for us to explore possibilities with RHB's management and shareholders,” added Nazir.In a separate statement, Maybank said the “potential transaction, if it materialises, would be consistent with Maybank's vision to become a regional financial services leader, and support its strategic objectives of being the undisputed No. 1 retail financial services provider in Malaysia and the leading Islamic bank in Asean, amongst others. The transaction will be evaluated based on the potential for value creation for Maybank's shareholders.”This development confirmed heated speculation in recent weeks that the country's largest and second largest banks, Maybank and CIMB respectively, were vying to take over RHB Cap, which is the fifth largest banking group. Sources said due to the rife market talk and “leaks”, Maybank and CIMB were directed by the central bank to disclose their interest to bid for RHB Cap to curb further speculation.Alongside this major takeover bid, is the sale of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank's (ADCB) 25% stake in RHB Cap.“There are two separate tracks - one is the acquisition of a strategic stake and the other is a full takeover,” said a source.At a board meeting held by ADCB yesterday to shortlist the bidders, the source said “three top bidders were identified”.However, he said the strategic block could most likely go to a sister company of ADCB, a state-owned Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) - Aabar Investments or Abu Dhabi Investment Council (Adic).The source said ADCB had received bids for its block from Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, a Chinese bank and several private equity firms including the Carlyle Group, ranging from 2 times to 2.5 times book value of RHB Cap.“ADCB will most likely sell to its sister company, another Abu Dhabi SWF, as it has deep pockets and this involves a strategic investment.“It shows Abu Dhabi's commitment to stay invested in Malaysia over the long term. The divestment is part of ADCB's rationalisation programme and also in line with the Government's plan to rationalise its banking assets under a single umbrella,” said the source.It is believed that ADIC or Aabar have offered to buy over the stake at 2.5 times RHB Cap's book value.As at end March 2011, RHB Cap's net tangible asset per share stood at RM4.79 and at 2.5 times book, it values the bank at close to RM12 per share. The counter closed at RM9.22 on Tuesday.“Although this includes a sale involving a sister company, it involves an arms length deal which allows ADCB to sell at a profit. This would offer the fastest closing with no uncertainty,” said the source.Will this set the benchmark pricing for Maybank or CIMB's takeover of RHB Cap? “Not at all,” said another source. “The sale of the strategic stake is a left-to-right hand transfer. That should not impact the price Maybank or CIMB would have to pay to take control of RHB Cap. Furthermore, those valuations are far too high,” said an observer.It is believed that the Employees Provident Fund, which owns 45% of RHB Cap, has yet to receive the notice from Maybank and CIMB for the potential merger while a source said ADCB will submit its application to start talks with the two banks to the central bank today.Meanwhile, RHB Cap board is expected to convene a board meeting over the next two days to discuss the potential merger plans.Ultimately, the key decision makers in the takeover bids would be the board of RHB Cap and the EPF. It is highly likely that both Maybank and CIMB would make a cash and share deal for the takeover.“No one is going to offer an all-cash deal as it's far too costly. In terms of who offers RHB Cap a better fit, both Maybank and CIMB can compete on the same ground.It all comes down to how much Maybank and CIMB value their own shares and at what premium, if at all, they would pay for RHB Cap shares in the swap,” said a source close to the deal.“At the end of the day, if it is earnings dilutive for CIMB or Maybank, it would be hard to justify the takeover to their respective shareholders.“They will just walk away from the deal. While it is good to have (RHB Cap), it is not a must have,” said the source.http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?f...83&sec=business",,,,,,,,,,,,

1995,lowyat,"http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?f...42&sec=businessQUOTEKUALA LUMPUR: Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), the country's largest bank in assets, is planning to take over Singapore stockbroker Kim Eng Holdings Ltd  in a deal valued at up to S$1.79bil (RM4.26bil) to grow its regional footprint in investment banking and stockbroking operations.Maybank will pay S$768mil (RM1.9bil) to buy a 44.6% stake in Kim Eng from chairman and chief executive officer Ronald Anthony Ooi and Taiwan's Yuanta Securities Asia Financial Services Ltd and launch a buyout offer for the remaining shares of the Singapore company which is ranked as a top 5 stockbroker in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «Kim Eng also has a presence in global financial centres in Hong Kong, London and New York.Maybank will approach Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings Co Ltd to discuss buying over the Japanese broker's 29.16% equity in Kim Eng.Maybank could also pay an additional RM500mil to buy the listed entities of Kim Eng in Thailand and the Philippines but first needs to discuss with the regulators there on the possibility of launching a general offer for those companies.The acquisition price of S$3.10 a share represents a multiple of 1.91 times Kim Eng's book value as at Sept 30, 2010, and premium of 15% to the last closing price of S$2.70.The acquisition price is a 28% premium to the one-month volume weighted average price of S$2.42.As at Sept 30, Kim Eng's total assets and shareholders' equity amounted to S$2.7bil and S$938mil respectively.“Kim Eng is a perfect complement to our existing strengths in investment banking and the equities market. It gives us the immediate platform to aggressively build up our global wholesale banking capabilities in Asean and beyond,” Maybank chairman Tan Sri Megat Zaharuddin Megat Mohd Nor said in a statement yesterday.Maybank president and CEO Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar said the acquisition represented a milestone in the expansion of the group's investment banking franchise and addressed a gap in the bank's Asean footprint.“Kim Eng's market leadership, complementary geographic footprint, product offerings and distribution capability, combined with our commercial banking franchise, provide immense potential for synergies,” he said.By purchasing Kim Eng, Maybank would have commercial banking, investment banking and stockbroking activities in nearly all of the major markets in South-East Asia. It would not have commercial banking operations in Thailand but Maybank believes the purchase of Kim Eng will offer insight into the Thai market.Ooi, who will continue to lead Kim Eng as CEO post the transaction for a minimum of three years, was equally excited over the transaction as the deal would allow Kim Eng to grow with the support of Maybank's strong balance sheet and well-entrenched client relationships. Maybank is retaining Kim Eng's core management team.Incorporated in 1989, Kim Eng is a leading stock broker in South-East Asia. The firm's leadership in stock broking has been recognised by several international publications, and is the top-ranked stockbroker in Thailand. It's No 2 in the Philippines in terms of market share, third in Indonesia and fourth in Singapore.The transaction is subject to approval from Bank Negara and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and is expected to be finalised by April.Maybank Investment Bank Bhd and Nomura Singapore Ltd are joint financial advisors to Maybank on the transaction.It is learnt that Kim Eng was also offered to CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, which already has broking operations in Singapore and the region after acquiring GK Goh Holdings Ltd in 2005.In November last year, Kim Eng entered into a RM131.5mil deal with Berjaya Corp Bhd (BCorp) where Kim Eng would propose to buy 70% stake in Inter-Pacific Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BCorp.Wahid, in a media conference yesterday evening, said Maybank was still interested in completing that transaction and would soon start discussions with BCorp as Interpacs reach in the retail market would complement Maybank Investment Bank's institutional business.He defended paying 1.9 times book value for Kim Eng, calling the price “a fair value,” as there were few brokers that offered the regional reach and investment banking franchise Kim Eng did.He said Kim Eng was a unique asset given its size, pan-regional platform, market leadership, earnings track record and diversified earnings base.“There is a premium attached with a controlling stake,” he said.To fund the acquisition, Maybank would use a combination of internal funds and borrowings, possibly Singapore dollar debt, to match the asset it is buying. Maybank said its dividend reinvestment plan, which allowed shareholders to receive new shares instead of cash, would boost its cash reserves and facilitate the purchase of Kim Eng. Its capital ratios post-acquisition would remain above the minimum requirements set by the regulator.In terms of branding, Maybank would prefer to retain some of the elements of Kim Eng's branding but would also like to capitalise on Maybank's regional franchise.Post-acquisition, Maybank's pro-forma group revenue would rise by 7% to RM13.7bil and with contribution from overseas rising from 29% to 33%. In terms of pre-tax profit, that would rise by 6% to RM5.9bil with pre-tax profit from abroad increasing to 25% from 21%.Contribution from investment banking activity to Maybank in terms of revenue and pre-tax profit on a pro-forma basis after the acquisition would rise from 2% to 8%.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1996,lowyat,"Maybank to Make $1.4 Billion Offer for Kim EngQUOTEMaybank, Malaysia's biggest lender, will make an offer to buy Singapore brokerage Kim Eng Holdings for $1.4 billion in the biggest ever deal involving a securities house in the city-state.This would be the first major deal in the industry in Singapore since 2005, when Malaysia's CIMB bought the brokerage unit of G.K. Goh Holdings for $146 million and comes at a time when Southeast Asian markets are on a roll.Maybank said that it is buying a 44.6 percent stake in Kim Eng from a unit of Taiwan's Yuanta Financial and the family that owns the Singapore broker for S$3.10 per share, a premium of about 15 percent to Wednesday's closing price.It is also making a conditional mandatory offer for the remaining shares it does not own.Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Securities also owns about 29 percent of Kim Eng and it was not clear whether it will sell the shares or not.The deal is expected to broaden Maybank's sources of  overseas revenue following its entry into Pakistan, Vietnam  and Indonesia to offset slowing growth in Malaysia's increasingly crowded financial market.Besides Singapore, Kim Eng also has a large operation in Thailand, where it is the biggest foreign broker in terms of market share and is also active in Philippines and Malaysia.""It should be positive for Maybank as it will broaden its overseas penetration,"" said Kaladher Govindan, research head at Malaysia's TA Securities.Maybank and Kim Eng shares rose nearly 3 percent on Wednesday before being suspended from trade on Thursday. Shares in Kim Eng, which has a market capitalization of about $1.26 billion, have risen over 35 percent since mid-December, when reports emerged of an impending stake sale.Source: http://www.cnbc.com/id/40935916",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Ini jelas menunjukkan rasa tidak hormat syarikat berkaitan kerajaan kepada pekerjanya sendiri, yang merupakan warga negara Malaysia.""Malah, ini bertentangan dengan aspirasi gagasan 1Malaysia dan Model Baru Ekonomi yang bermatlamat mewujudkan masyarakat berpendapatan tinggi.

2026,lowyat,"Hi folks. I need some clarifications here. Yesterday I received a call from a woman claiming to be an Etiqa staff. She asked me if I'm free to talk and started to promoted her Etiqa insurance. I just listened to her halfheartedly while doing my own work until she mentioned that Etiqa will deduct RM74 from account every month (although I never agreed to it). The dialogs were something like these,-----------------------Woman: Ok, so now we'll be deducting RM74 from your account every month. Before that we'll need to ask a few questions. Me: Eh wait, I never said I'm going to buy the insurance. I'm still studying and I'm already covered by another insurance.Woman: Don't worry, it's only RM74 and your parents will surely agree to it. And let say in the case your parents had an accident, will you be able to pay for it? Me: Can I think about it later and if I'm interested, I'll just call you or go to any Maybank branch?Woman: This is special because you are one of the few selected Maybank account holders and entitled for the special price. This offer is only available by phone conversation. The usual price is normally RM1++.(Now it's becoming weirder)Woman: And if you think RM74 is too high, you can also go for the RM44. You now have two choices, RM74 or RM44.(And there's not even a choice to reject both..)Me: Can I at least see the T&C or any black and white first?Woman: Well, sir, the whole agreement is based on this phone conversation which will be recorded.Me: I'm sorry, I can't make the decision now as I mentioned I'm still studying and I already have another insurance. Woman: Ok then, we'll just have to remove you from the list and give others who needed it.------------------------------Well, the question is, Is this some kind of a scam? Can they really make the agreement via phone call without our signature, etc? And let say, they still deduct from my account, can I take some legal action since there's no proof on my side either.Well sorry for the tl;dr. Hope someone can share their thoughts here as well. Btw, although I should just put down the phone, I choose not to. I thought, maybe I can just play along and not to be rude at the same time.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,

2037,lowyat,"Im Maybank Credit Card Holder. Applied One of the maybank product - SONY Credit Card at Year 2007. Card Expired on 31/8/2010. Purpose application : To enjoy benefits from SONY Products by using SONY Card.I know that card expiry date, i called customer service no. stated in internet www.maybank2u.com to check for the renewal card.July 2010 - Called to check when will i receive my renewal credit card. Confirmed with the staff, mine is SONY Card. Identity Verified with around 4 questions. I have been told that the renewal card will sent to my residential address and will received before expiry date.1st week of August 2010 - I received a notice from maybank request me to go menara maybank at KL to collect my renewal card. I immediately call up the customer service to request sent it to my office address instead due to my workin hour is same with banking hour. I have been verified around 10 questions.  Office address and update contact number ,i have repeated twice, the customer service repeated once, therefore the information i gave confirmed is correct at that point time. I have been inform i will receive my card within 7 working days. August 2010 - After 7 days, i call up again to the same number and been verified by 4 questions again coz i havent receive my card. The customer service told me that the address given is invalid and the banks are unable to contact me. When i ask them to repeat the office address and my updated two handphone numbers, which shows that they either dint record it properly and dint update my information. the number they repeat is my old number. So fine, I gave the information (address and phone number) again, and repeated and double confirmed three times with the customer service. I have been informed that i will receive in 2 weeks. September 2010 - I notice the bank charge me for the govt tax RM50. My card might be on the way.2 and half weeks later, i received my card finally. But the despatch complaint to me they cant find the address and unable to contact me. When look into it, I got upset that because the wrong address and my outdated contact information (Lucky the company name half correct, Im giving credit to SKYNET that they try their best to locate the location). What service is maybank giving ? The consumer unable to update information through ebanking, and now call up to update few  times but yet to update ? I thought it was a relieve when i received my renewal card. Then i only realise, The maybank issued me a WRONG CARD !I called them immediately to clarify the situation and update my contact information again.The customer service insist saying that all this THREE YEARS im using a VISA CLASSIC CARD and NOT SONY CARD. Im wondering are they testing my nerves, my credit card printed with SONY CARD and i used for three years. The customer service says she checked and the bank will issued me a new sony card and will sent it to bandar baru ampang branch and apologise for the mistake.September 2010 - One week later, i called up to check status. Everything back to square one. The customer service says there is no record found that the bank reissue me a new sony card. and insist saying that im using visa classic all the while. (Im not blind seriously, i can see my card).She says will make a report, and request to issue me a new card, and wait for two weeks. I have been told that i can temporary use the new card while waiting for the SONY card. The card no need to be activate, it can be used straight away when i received. ( WOW This worries me when i heard this, My delivery address and phone number , the bank didnt update it. What if the card fall on someone hands ? Oh My God ! )September 2010 - One and half week later. I called up to check status again. The customer service says no new card to be issue to me, and only apply to get approval fro manager to change the CARD TYPE from VISA CLASSIC to SONY CARD internally and request me do not use that credit card that been claim issued wrongly and wait for the bank reply for another two weeks. Hello, i have been paid for the govt tax, im good paymaster, and now i have to bare banks mistakes which made at 2007 ?September 2010- Which is today. No news from maybank regarding my renewal credit card. I, do not work at maybank. I do not know how to check the card type in their bank system. I wonder is there anyone out there might face this problem which they dint realise ? Consumer apply Product A, But the bank Gave Product B but system record as Product B.and consumer have bare the bank mistake ?I wonder if this case, can i request refund of the govt tax from the bank ? They have charged me to a product which im not applying to.These two months i have spent quite some money on phone bill for just calling the customer service.

2043,lowyat,"before this on june i join the etiqa saving program which the agent claim to me is a saving account with some protection plan. after some research done by reading information in this section,i came to a solution that we can get all the money back in 30 years according to the program. this is my question:1- i pay rm 300/month for the plan which mean rm 3600/year. the agent said they will even giv me interest/year (cuz they using the money ppl pay to do some business wit maybank) which mean i get some extra money just like fix deposit but with higher rate i think. is it true?okey. now the problem is recently etiqa maybank sent me a letter regarding the issue of some agent misunderstand the system of the plan and asking me to read the letter carefully as i get to terminate my account in 15 days since i start receiving the letter. The letter somehow showed that it is different indeed with what the prev agent said as it state dat the interest i get is not constant and may become non at all. while they keep putting a big picture (even in the latest letter i receive) about having total amount rm 275000 at my final payment after 30 years while saving 3600/year for 30 years means rm 108000. so how the money grow to 275000 while dey cant even guarantee the interest rate and for some reasons,from what i understand the letter said dat the money for my protection plan can only claim if i am fully paralyzed. so how now. i think the protection plan is worst den i thought. anyone get the same thing? kindly reply me pls. thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2132,lowyat,"Dear Lowyatians,There is a post on this matter which is http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/682225 but I open this topic as a new topic since the whole concept for this saving plan is totally misunderstood by certain friends in this forum. Here is the total idea of this plan.There are many saving plan under Etiqa Maybank but the one giving highest dividen is 12.5% out of ""Basic Sum Insured"" and the dividend can be taken out every 3 years. Where is the proof for this statement? Well,I have attached the part of the policy stating this term. I have included the image of it in this topicThis maybank plan is not a scam. The proof?Visit the site belowhttp://www.maybank2u.com.my/mbb_info/m2u/public/personalDetail04.do?channelId=&cntTypeId=1&cntKey=AU04.02.01&programId=AU04.02-InsuranceTakaful&chCatId=/mbb/AboutUs/AU04-MaybankSubsidiariesStill dont believe? Want to see the brochure?Visit this sitehttp://www.etiqa.com.my/English/Insurance/products/Personal/savings/Pages/TwinSpecial.aspxThe concept is like this.1. Let say you are 25 years old.2. You are saving rm200 per month and it is auto-deductible from your account(Maybank/CIMB/BSN)3. When you are paying rm200/month, it falls under ""Plan RM30000"". Which means that dividend given 12.5% from Rm30000 every 3 years.4. This means that a) you get rm3750 every 3 years                             b) and it also means that you get rm1250/year                           c) which conclude that you get roughly rm100 per month.If we really think, we save rm200 per month and we get rm100 per month. Is it great?Another point need to be stressed is this 12.5% dividend is fixed and it is not fluctuate-dividend.  You can stop this plan at 10th years or 24th years.Basically you will earn around rm100000 dividend for 24years saving plan.Please PM me for more info and we can meet up for more details.p.s.For government staffs or semi-government staffs, the payment can be done directly from your pay and will be stated in your pay-slipIf you guys still have doubts, please raise out and we can discuss here.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2180,lowyat,"Guan Eng claims Maybank losses are higher than claimedBy Syed Jaymal ZahiidKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 17 — Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng today claimed state-owned Maybank had under-reported the actual losses incurred on its foreign investments in devalued overseas banks.According to Lim, the bank had actually recorded a loss of RM2.75 billion on its investments in Indonesian bank BII and Pakistan's MCB Bank instead of what it had reported in its fourth quarter report recently.Maybank in its June 30 fiscal report said profit dropped 76 per cent from the previous quarter as a result of impairment losses of RM1.97 billion for acquiring the two banks.Lim said the losses are actually some RM780 million more than reported.In a statement today, Lim said Maybank had bought BII for RM7.9 billion and spent RM2.87 billion on MCB and these banks are now only valued at RM5.77 billion and RM2.25 billion respectively.As such, he said, the impairment loss, which is the writedown in an overstated value of an asset to a fair value, should be RM2.75 billion and not RM1.97 billion as reported by Maybank.""This RM780 million difference between RM1.97 billion and RM2.75 billion in losses may not be big by banking standards but huge for public interest,"" said Lim.Maybank, the country's biggest banking group, was heavily criticised by Putrajaya for the acquisition of BII which resulted in Bank Negara ordering a sweeping overhaul of its board of directors.The overhaul, done without much publicity, was endorsed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak himself who ordered Bank Negara to review the contentious transaction.Maybank’s main shareholders are national equity fund Permodalan Nasional and pension fund Employees Provident Fund.Lim said public interest demands that action be taken against those responsible for the losses.""As Maybank is government owned, the public has every right to demand full public accountability and action against those responsible for such reckless management decisions.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ",,,,,,,,,,,,

2224,lowyat,"I received a call from Prestige Platinum Card center from Kuala Lumper 0162278607this morning. The caller is a Malay lady who knew my name and she asked for my card expiry date for verification purpose. It was very suspicious as the background of the caller is so noisy and the caller is speaking in Bahasa. Normally Maybank staffs are fluent in English. Then I asked her why she was asking for the card information as in I am their customer  . She kept telling me for verification purpose. I was too stupid to think that giving them the card numbers will not enable the company make any transaction for long as I don't reveal my CVV number (I was wrong). Immediately, I called the Maybank customer service, the 1st receiver was so arrogant. She sounds like condemning me being stupid to reveal card information. I nearly quarreled with her over the phone  . She told me she can't do anything for this case and asking me to call back the Digi caller. She asked me to monitor my account, call the maybank again once found suspicious charge. Stupid & bad attitude, I might at risk & probably will induce more dispute, I afraid Maybank will insist to charge me later. As I insisted to cancel my credit card else I will cut the card myself. She said I have go to the branch myself to cancel it. Can you imagine how worry I am. It is weekend. Which Maybank branch open on weekend??Furiously, I called back the same number ""Prestige Platinum"". Another lady, Dina picked up the phone and claim that she is under Maybank card center..What the hell.Then I pretending asking her why the other lady called me just now. She said she will check again.Luckily I found this blog. http://blog.cyberpartygal.com/index.php/20...a-kuala-lumpur/Then I know Maybank can block the transaction/cancel the card and give a replacement. I called Maybank service center again. Luckily, this time the customer service personnel was friendlier. Mr Chow patiently listen to my complaint. He told me giving the expiry date and card number might have risk too even though I din give them my CVV number.He canceled my card and replace a new 1 for me. All the installment plan are not affected also. But when I asked what can Maybank do to prevent this, as I told him I could give them the number for their investigation on the fraud. However, he is reluctant to do so..Compare with others' experience, they were all been offered VIP cards etc. But I was not being offered anything. Maybe this is a new scam from them. As they knew my time, I thought their verification purpose is true.So what can we do now is sharing the experience remind the public don't repeat the same mistake again. Don't reveal anything about the card to third party. BEWARE!",,,,,,,,,,,,

Right now I'm paying via ESI (standing instruction) that will deduct a pre-determined amount from my account every 1st day of the month. I can also pay more by using the 'Online Bill Payment > Maybank Loan / Hire Purchase'.Now, I'm assuming that if I transferred money through this method, it will end up at the 'Payment In Advance' balance in my loan account. How do I pay so that it will reduce the principal amount of the loan instead of waiting to be deducted at the end of the month? I'm planning to pay more these days to reduce the interest amount.If Maybank doesnt allow me to reduce principal balance automatically (e.g I have to write formal letter etc.. zzzzZZzz), am planning to refinance the property with another bank after my locked-in period in 2 year's time.

Click on the Menu tab on the left and select Secure2u then follow the setup instructions. They will be asked to key in a one-time password sent to their phone number, enter ID number and then submit.A separate app Mae by Maybank2u also utilises one-tap authorisation method. Users will receive a notification alert on their phone and they have 50 seconds to approve or reject the transaction on the app.The company had previously made Secure2u the only authorisation method for transactions above RM5,000 starting on Feb 16, and subsequently for transactions of RM4,000 and above on Feb 24.Secure2u is currently used to authorise transactions valued at RM3,000 and above, which came into effect on March 8.After each effective date, SMS TAC was no longer generated for users.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Group chief executive officer (Community Financial Services) Datuk John Chong said in light of the pandemic, the e-Angpao service provides customers who are unable to meet with their families a safe and convenient way to participate in the cherished tradition.“We hope that the e-Angpao will be able to give them a sense of normalcy and a chance to bond with their family members despite having to physically distance themselves to keep everyone safe,” he said.The bank said it had received an encouraging response to its e-Angpao service in 2020, where the number of transactions increased to 840,000. It added that the e-Angpao service is expected to grow in 2021 as more customers become comfortable with the notion of sending e-Angpao during Chinese New Year, especially in the new normal.Maybank customers can send e-Angpao to family and friends by clicking on the e-Angpao icon exclusively on the all-new app, MAE by Maybank2u, from today (Feb 8) until Mar 7.https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mayb...ransactions-cny",,,,,,,,,,,,

They want to focus more on MAE branding that functions like a super app for everything Maybank2. M2U acts like a secondary feature in the MAE app to cater current Maybank users / cardholders3. They want new users to go for MAE instead of M2U, that is why they allow new users to apply for a new Maybank account that ties with MAE via the app, and also use the MAE card for e wallet / savings / payments etc. (which is also the reason why there's a ""Tabung"" feature in the app that lets you track your spending and also savings)4.

I was told that until the early 2000s, almost half of the lecturers at Singapore universities were from Malaysia.  Mainly non-Malays.  Some years ago, the present Sultan of Selangor mentioned in a press article that he knew of a Malaysian Indian who was very well qualified who applied to University of Malaya for a position as a lecturer.  He was turned down for allegedly being not qualified enough.  He went to Singapore and was accepted as a lecturer, and later went on to head his department.

It would be very foolish if the 1957 Federal Constitution also gives the Chinese Special  Chinese rights/position today, eg the huge risk in having 30% of the Malaysian armed forces/police comprising of Chinese = many of them may become Chinese traitors/spies/moles/supporters/sympathizers for the communist cause/ideology.This is one of the reason that the 1957 Special Malay rights/position should remain and be continued, ie to prevent the Chinese communist threat since there are still many Malaysian Chinese who see communist CCP China as their hero Big Brother, eg they cheered for Lin Dan and China during badminton competitions..",,,,,,,,,,,,

2912,lowyat,"Maybank Launches New MAE By Maybank2u App, Offers New Features For Better Financial ManagementMaybank has launched the MAE by Maybank2U app, an all-new app that aims to help Malaysians take charge of their everyday money matters beyond regular banking needs and to provide a fresh, next-generation experience. It brings together the many digital banking functions offered by Maybank under one app – mobile banking, QR Payments, and the MAE e-wallet – and is also equipped with several other new features for better financial management.Maybank’s existing mobile banking app, Maybank2u, will eventually be replaced by the new MAE by Maybank2u app introduced today.At the launch of the new MAE app, both Datuk Abdul Farid Alias, Group President and Chief Executive Offer of Maybank, and Dato’ John Chong, Group Chief Executive Officer, Community Financial Services, confirmed that the existing Maybank2u app will be phased out in the future.You can download the new MAE app from  Google Play or the App Store. Just search MAE by Maybank2Uhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM9clRXhd7k...ature=emb_titleMaybank Launches New MAE By Maybank2u App, Offers New Features For Better Financial ManagementFirst and foremost, the new MAE app is a separate app from the existing Maybank2u app, and it is not the MAE e-wallet that lives within the Maybank2u app. Instead, Maybank has positioned the new app as “a pocketable digital bank but with many cool features”.The MAE app is designed to contain your digital wallet and will also serve your daily financial needs, such as paying bills, conducting money transfers, splitting bills, and making reloads. It also has the Scan & Pay function, which lets you carry out QR payments at 450,000 merchants nationwide. All your existing Maybank2u functions, meanwhile, will be tucked away at the bottom of your dashboard – allowing for easy accessibility but also safely compartmentalised from the non-banking functions on the platform.Interestingly, the new app now also lets you customise the dashboard to your preferences, which means that you can move things around and add shortcuts to features that are most relevant to you. For instance, if you are a deal-seeker, you can tweak your home screen so that you see relevant promotions first. This brings a whole new level of personalisation to the MAE app.MAE Visa Debit CardThe new app also comes with a new debit card for your day-to-day spending, and it supports Visa PayWave contactless payment. Some of its key benefits is the competitive foreign exchange rates, as well as exclusive perks that can be enjoyed both locally and abroad.If you are travelling, the amount in your MAE wallet will also auto-convert to the currency of the country that you’re in, letting you know how much exactly is available for spending. There is also an added security feature that lets you instantly freeze or unfreeze your card via the app if you feel the need to.Customers can apply for the MAE Visa debit card via the MAE app, and it will be delivered directly to their doorsteps within seven working days. Also, note that the MAE Visa debit card is not meant to replace your current Maybank debit card as the former is linked to your digital wallet (MAE), whereas the latter is directly linked to your savings account.The rest of them, please read this website.

No perks involved.Even Maybank Mae also I don't bother.Of course the main restriction here is you need a HKID, which makes opening a bank account in HK much stricter than SG.The main perks for HK vbanks is that the interest rate is much higher than traditional banks. Imagine Hang Seng pays you 0.001% and Mox pays you 1% (actual rate, can check at their websites). Obviously you would choose Mox over Hang Seng since now both have no fall-below fees and the interest paid on idle funds in vbanks is 1000 times higher. Of course I am not asking you to borrow, spend on PCCW/Trip.com products/services (they have a stake in Mox), invest or subscribe to their wealth management service which would be their main source of profit. Just for the sake of saving with a 1% risk-free interest, why would a Malaysian in HK not seize this opportunity? As for TW borderless and Revolut, they don't publish their interest rate on idle funds or perhaps they don't pay any interest.

2937,lowyat,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced Tuesday.The CDC’s moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide until Dec. 31 and goes into effect immediately, senior administration officials said of an unpublished CDC agency order. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel Tuesday that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters.A previous federal eviction moratorium created by the CARES Act ended in late July and only applied to federally-funded housing, including rental units with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae FNMA, -0.93%  and Freddie Mac FMCC, -0.48%  . The moratorium will apply to any state in which there is not already a more protective ban in effect, according to the order. Multiple states have eviction moratoriums in place, including California, which established new rules in a late-night vote Monday.Renters will be eligible for the moratorium’s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually.The order, which was shared ahead of being published in the Federal Register on Sept. 4, includes a declaration for renters to sign and give their landlord. Senior Trump administration officials said the form would be made available on the CDC’s website.Renters must indicate on the declaration that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that if evicted they would become homeless or force to move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent.The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full.Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instances in which the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the health or safety of neighbors.The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.“In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria — like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing — can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,” the CDC’s unpublished order said.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cdc-issue...irus-2020-09-01",,,,,,,,,,,,

2960,lowyat,"Mexico City approves bill to criminalise gay ‘conversion therapy’Source: https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/mexico-city...ersion-therapy/Mexico City’s regional congress approved a bill to criminalise gay ‘conversion therapy’ in a virtual session on Friday 24 July.The practice – which has been discredited by the NHS and the World Psychiatric Association – refers to any attempt at changing a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity and often involves techniques such as electroshock therapy or prayer.The new law, hailed as a major step forward for LGBTQ+ citizens in Mexico, would sentence offenders with up to five years in prison and there would be harsher punishments for those who subject minors to the practice.It also defines ‘conversion therapy’ as a psychological or psychiatric measure that intends to “nullify, hinder, modify or undermine” the expression of a person’s gender identity or their sexual orientation.LGBTQ+ activists praised the outcome on social media, with Jóvenes LGBT México writing on Twitter: “Today, one more fight has been consolidated in our city and so has one more chapter in the history of the LGBT+ movement in Mexico. I feel very happy to walk hand in hand with all of you. This victory is yours.”Mexico City’s ban on ‘conversion therapy’ follows recent calls for Boris Johnson to criminalise the practice in the UK.Ban Conversion Therapy, a new group which works closely with LGBTQ+ charities and human rights organisations, are calling for a comprehensive and swift ban.An open letter to the prime minister and Downing Street has also attracted the support of numerous celebrities.The letter, backed by Elton John, Stephen Fry, Dua Lipa, Little Mix’s Jade Thirlwall, Stonewall, Mermaids, The Ozanne Foundation, Amnesty UK, Gendered Intelligence, All-Out and many others was sent to Downing Street and Equalities Minister, Liz Truss, on 10 July.Other signatures include Olly Alexander from Years & Years, trans activist Munroe Bergdorf, screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, actor Alan Cumming, writer Russell T. Davies, comedian Mae Martin, Liberal Democrat leadership contender Layla Moran, co-founder of UK Black Pride Phyll Opoku-Gyimah and singers Rina Sawayama and Charli XCX.Social media giant Instagram has also pledged to ban all content relating to the promotion of ‘conversion therapy.’“We don’t allow attacks against people based on sexual orientation or gender identity and are updating our policies to ban the promotion of conversion therapy services,” Tara Hopkins, EMEA public policy director, told BBC News.“We are always reviewing our policies and will continue to consult with experts and people with personal experiences to inform our approach.”Instagram added that it will take some time to roll out the policy across its platform, so while all content promoting ‘conversion therapy’ won’t immediately be removed, over time it will be blocked.Added on Malaysia can save a lot of precious ringgit if we manage to stop state-sanctioned conversion therapies like the ones under JAKIM.

There are two methods, the full or the quick ones. For the full method, prepare ingredients as you would make tomyum soup, finely chop all fresh ingredients such as garlic, galangal, shallots, bird's eye chilies, kaffir lime leaves (remove veins and slice into fine stripes), and lemongrass. Saute fresh ingredients until fragrant, add chicken if you like. Then add mae pranom thai chili paste, salt, oyster mushroom. Pour in rice, lastly seasoned with fish sauce and lime juice. The tomato can be used as garnish, no need to include in the cooking.For the quick method, saute only chopped garlic and shallots, add chicken if you like. Add in and saute instant tomyum paste (peace brand is ok), mae pranom thai chili paste, salt, oyster mushroom, pour in rice and stir fry. No need fish sauce and lime juice because the instant paste already has those. For good and authentic tasting tomyum fried rice, don't skip the mae pranom thai chili paste regardless which method you use. I don't usually use eggs but crack an egg in the middle of frying the rice if you like, add some little oil as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Before boarding, the carrier's staff is required to check the self-certification (to download the form) setting out the following detailed information: the reasons for travelling to Italy (health needs, work requirements, reasons of absolute necessity), the place of self-isolation for 14 days, own or otherwise private means of transportation used to get to the place of self-isolation and a mobile/land phone number. The reasons of ""absolute necessity"" are as specified in the FAQs previously posted on the website.2. All persons entering Italy, whether at an airport, ferry port or railway station, must avoid using public transport and must therefore make arrangements to be picked up, take a taxi, if and as allowed, or hire a car, with or without a driver. For airport transits see the specific FAQ.3. All persons entering Italy are required to self-isolate, including persons with their own transport. Persons travelling to Italy for work may postpone the start of the self-isolation period by 72 hours (which can be extended for a further 48 hours), albeit only if strictly necessary.4. All persons entering Italy, including persons with their own transport, are required to report to the local health authorities on arrival at their destination. 5. All persons entering Italy may self-isolate either at home or other place of their choice.6. If a person entering Italy has no place for self-isolation, or is unable to travel to their place of self-isolation (if they have no-one to pick them up, if there are no available hotel rooms, etc.), they will be required to self-isolate at a location established by the Civil Protection Service, at the interested person's expense.7. The above rules do not apply to the following persons: cross-border workers, health services personnel, passenger/freight transport crews.Ordinance by the Ministry of Health, in agreement with the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, issued on 28.03.2020 	•	 I'm an Italian expat or a foreign national resident in Italy, may I return to Italy?Yes, but only for emergency reasons. For example, Italian nationals, or foreign nationals resident in Italy, who are abroad temporarily (for tourism, business or other reasons) are allowed to return to Italy. Italian nationals obliged to leave the foreign country where they were working or studying (because they've lost their job or home, or because the study programme they were attending has been suspended) are likewise allowed to return to Italy. * I live abroad and need to transit through Italy on my way to the country where I live. What must I do?Transit through Italy, from one foreign country to another, for the purpose of travelling home as quickly as possible and without any unnecessary stopovers, is allowed, for work requirements, medical needs or reasons of absolute necessity. Following are several examples: - airport transit is allowed (for example, when travelling from Caracas to Frankfurt via Rome Fiumicino), provided that you do not leave the airport; - cruise ship passengers disembarking in Italy at the end of the cruise are allowed to return to their home countries (at the expense of the cruise ship owner); - passengers are allowed to board private vehicles on a ferry (from Tunisia or Greece to Italy) and then continue by car to their home country (in the Netherlands or Germany, for example). When boarding a flight/ferry to Italy from abroad you must fill in this self-certification document (link to Foreign form) clearly specifying that you are a transit passenger travelling to another foreign country. While travelling through Italy you may be required to show this self-declaration document if stopped by any law enforcement officers (link to Interior form), clearly indicating the same reason. If you develop any Covid-19 symptoms while in Italy, you must immediately notify the competent health authorities, at the dedicated number, and follow their instructions. In any case, before planning any travel you are advised to seek information on the travel restrictions in force not just in Italy, but also in the countries of departure, transit and destination. When transiting through Italy you are also advised to contact your embassy or consulate offices in this country. * I am travelling to Italy on a flight from abroad. Can I take an onward flight to another domestic or international destination?Yes, you are allowed to transit through any Italian airport, provided that you do no leave the airport. In any case, your journey to the final destination must be justified by work requirements or health needs or reasons of absolute necessity, as for all other travel. * I'm a foreign national in Italy, may I return to my home country?Yes, but only if it is absolutely necessary and observing the same conditions that apply to Italian nationals returning from abroad (see the FAQ). The temporary suspension of work, or switching to a home working arrangement, are not sufficient reasons for travelling. To declare the reasons for travelling to the border, Please use the self-certification form available at the Interior Ministry website.Before departing, you are advised to check the measures put into place in the country of destination to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and to contact your embassy in Italy as well. * I'm returning to Italy from abroad. May I ask someone to pick me up at the arrival airport, railway station or port?Yes, but only one person living in the same home as you and possibly wearing protective equipment. This type of movement is considered a matter of the ""utmost urgency"" and indicated as such on the self-certification form that can be downloaded at the Interior Ministry website. The self-certification must be fully compiled and must specify the journey and the destination place of residence.You are obviously required to immediately report your return to the Prevention Department of the competent local health authority and shall be subject to health surveillance and self-isolation, and to promptly report the development of any symptoms of Covid-19 infection to the healthcare services.https://mobile.twitter.com/ITAKuala_Lumpur/...012471640383488",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's always polite to greet them back when they greet you.-Good morning - ohayou gozaimasu -Hello/Good afternoon - Konnichiwa-Good evening - konbanwa-Escalator rules - In Japan, if you are not in a hurry and want to take your time standing and going up or down an escalator, do stand on the left side to avoid causing ""jam"" to other peoples. Right side of the escalator is considered as fast lane where people will walk fast instead of standing there.-Don't eat and walk, unlike Malaysia where we can easily find trash can almost everywhere or just ""make"" our own trash can anywhere, it's not easy to find trash can in Japan. Also it's considered rude to eat and walk in Japan. So whenever you purchase some street foods, stand nearby to eat it and pass back the trash to the store owner if he din't prepare a trash can in front of his/her store.-Don't stand in front of a cashier if you are not preparing to pay or if it isn't your turn to pay yet. Often in Japan, there will be an arrow on the ground not so close to the counter where everyone will queue behind it.Recommendation of Restaurants credit to Chinti» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «im putting a list of restaurant in tokyo here, they are all awesome according to my taste so if it doesnt suite ur taste please don't bash me. if u wan photo of them, u have to wait till im back from tokyo next month. i won't be recommending any michelin places as you can easily google those.Yakitori - i recommend a place call Toriyoshi 鳥よし in Naka-Meguro, the price is pretty standard and what i like about here is it doesn't get you all smelly and of cause the yakitori is one of the best.Soba - Kanda Yabusoba in Akihabara, this is one of the top 3 soba places in tokyo for locals. Nice place and they have english menu as well if you cant read japanese.Ramen - Hayashi in Shibuya, this is one of the best i tried in tokyo and is better than the michelin star ramen in Sugamo. It's a place where tourists will not go, only have like 9 seats. This shop only open from 11.30am to 3.30pm. They only have one selection and different sizes, easy right?Tempura - Tentake in Asakusa, well not much to say bout tempura other than its one of the best one in Asakusa.Bara chirashi don - Sushi Sho in Yotsuya, they served bara chirashi don every monday, wednesday, and friday. The shop open at 11.30am and they only served 20 bowls per day, its the best you can find in Tokyo. You can make reservation one month in advance or you can just go there earlier and hope they have a slot for you.Taiyaki - Taiyaki Wakaba in Yotsuya, this is the place i always go after having bara chirashi don at Sushi Sho as they are located within the same area. One of the best taiyaki for locals with a lot of red beans paste inside unlike some taiyaki place with only a bit of red bean paste.Abura soba (oily soba) - Abura Soba in Akihabara, honestly i dunno what is the name of this shop called despite eating here one year until i collected enough stamp for their t-shirt >< You can see a big sign ""油"" and its near an alley 5 min walk from Akiba station. They served the best abura(oily) soba i have ever tasted. There a many abura soba shop with the sign like that so don't go to the wrong 1. Maid cafe - I know many people sure want to experience maid cafe when they go Akiba, but there are tons of it so which one is the best and have many kawaii maid? My personal favourite is @At Home cafe, there are many floors so you can go each floor to have a look at their maids first see which floor you like.  thumbup.gif Sushi - If you wan cheap and nice, you can go conveyor belt sushi in Shibuya, there is one inside Seibu on the top floor called Midori Sushi if im not mistaken. If you have more budget, go to 梅丘寿司の美登利 (Umegaoka Sushi no Midori) inside Shibuya Tokyo Mark City 4th floor, usual wait time about an hour to two hours but definitely worth it. (take note that tsukiji market sushi is overpriced and standard only if u ever thinking of heading there for sushi)also for those that have a lot of money to spare, do make a reservation for Kyubey sushi in ginza, it is 2nd best sushi i ever had after Jiro sushi (im sure everyone noe bout this 1) and its way easier to get a reservation. Took me 4 months just to get a reservation for Jiro sushi ><Kyubey sushi is as fresh as Jiro sushi, price also almost the same at 40k yen per course. the different is the way they make it, definitely worth it if u got some money to spare.Unagi - Obana in Minami-Senju, this one seriously one of the best i had and the price is also not expensive compared to other unagi restaurant. No reservation needed but its recommended as its always full house. Mini two days Kyoto itinerary credit to Chinti» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «here's a mini two days itinerary/guide for Kyoto that i planned for my baby sis for her current trip, she's now in kyoto and will be meeting me in tokyo on thursday. this itinerary only tell u where to go as well as how to reach there (the train stop and bus stop). the time will not be shown as different people have different timing. all the places are planned according to how near they are to each other, this will make your travel easier so you don't ended up going to the other end of Kyoto and come back to the other end again.this two days itinerary also cover most of the Kyoto attractions already, if you want to enjoy each attraction longer, you can always split them up into maybe 3 days or 4 days. my personal suggestion is 3 days is enough for Kyoto as its pretty boring at night.Day 1-->Reach Kansai Airport-->Take Haruka Express to Kyoto-->Arashiyama (At Kyoto station, take JR Sagano/JR San-in Line To Arashiyama, stop at Saga Arashiyama Station)-all the attractions in Arashiyama are within walking distance, so just slowly take your time to walk around-Bamboo Grove-Monkey Park Iwatayama-Tenryuji Temple-Jojakkoji Temple-Gio Temple-Adashino Nenbutsuji-->Fushimi Inari Taisha (From Arashiyama, take JR San-in Line back to Kyoto Station, then switch to JR Nara Line to Fushimi Inari *stop at Inari station*)-->Dinner at Gion (From Fushimi Inari station, take Keihan Line to Gion-Shijo Station)-walk around and find any restaurant you like for dinner-walk around the town until you tired then head back to your hotel/hostel and call it a dayDay 2-->Kiyomizu-dera (Take whichever bus/train from the place you stay to there)-suggest going around 8am to avoid crowd-->Heian Shrine (From Kiyomizu-dera, walk to Shimizumichi Bus Stop. Take 市営１００京都駅前行 bus to Okazaki Koen, and walk to Heian Shrine)-->Ginkakuji (Walk back to Okazaki Koen, and take the same 市営１００京都駅前行 bus to Ginkakujimae Station)-->Kamigamo-Jinja (Walk to Ginkakujimichi Bus Stop, take 市営２０３乙錦林車庫前行 bus to Horikawaimadegawa Bus Stop. At the same bus stop, take 市営９西賀茂車庫前行 bus to Kamigamo Misonohashi Bus Stop and walk to Kamigamo-Jinja)-->Kinkakuji (Walk to Kamigamo Jinjamae Bus Stop, take 加茂線 出町柳駅前行 bus to 北大路堀川, and switch to 市営１２立命館大学前行 bus to Kinkakujimae Bus Stop, then walk to Kinkakuji)-there are quite a few different ways and buses to reach Kinkakuji from Kamigamo-Jinja, so just use google map to check whichever is faster during that time-->Geisha Street (Walk to Kinkakujimae Bus Stop, take 市営５９山越中町行 bus to Shijokawaramachi)-there are quite a few different buses to Geisha Street as well, so just google map whichever is faster-walk around, have dinner, then head to Kyoto Station and head back to OsakaKANSAI Good Tip for Unique Open Air Coach contributed by yooyinQUOTETicket can be purchased online (via Klook) and just pick up ticket at KIX or OSAKA Airport. To experience Unique Open Air Coach ""The Rich"" (Coach No.5) which is the best, tickets are only available as a same-day ticket in Sagano-line Station booth. You need to specifically inform the staff that you want Coach Number 5, otherwise, they will give you normal coach (window).Recommendation: Do the Sagano Train in the morning from Kameoka torokko station backwards to Arashiyama torokko station. Take JR line to Umahori Station, then walk to Kameoka torokko Station. Be there 30 minutes or earlier to secure ticket. Ticket counter opens 8.50am at Kameoka torokko station and depending on the crowd in the station, if there are 20+ people already in queue, it's likely they will open up 5-10 minutes earlier to ease up the crowd.

This is based on some restaurants we visited based on recommendations online and also random walk-in when we were walking around.The convenience store food like sandwiches and their desserts were really yummy. Also, Family Mart and Lawson's fried chicken 2) Osaka is a shopping heaven. It's absolutely crazy and there are SO MANY people around at the shopping streets and there are so many pharmacies/shops - Tenjinbashi, Shinsaibashi, Ebisubashi, Namba Walk. Literally shop till you drop!3) Kyoto is an absolutely amazing place to relax and unwind. So many lovely streets in the Higashiyama district and you can really wander around. Arashiyama is another lovely example, though I hated the crowd there.4) Gotta be careful when using google maps taking the trains as there are many types of trains; Express, Limited express, Rapid express, Semi-express, Sub express. There was one instance where Google Maps asked us to take Limited Express to Nara (can't remember the location) and we tapped ICOCA when we entered the station and when we wanted to enter the train, the conductor told us we need to get tickets so we had to buy tickets. We found out some Limited Express trains require an extra surcharge.Also there are other times where we did not even need to purchase tickets for the limited express trains and we sat at some ""Elegant Saloon 8000 series carriage"" which we thought was reserved but it wasn't.We actually had a harder time using the bus than the train. Like we were supposed to take bus number 5 and there is some extra japanese kanji at the side of it. We checked that it was going to the right direction (For example Bus no.5 heading towards direction of Kyoto Eki mae) but it was the wrong bus maybe because of the different kanji next to the number?Luckily a very nice old man saw us struggling and handed us a map with all the bus routes, it was so much easier with it.5) Hardly any dustbins in the streets of Osaka and Kyoto. In the end, have to pass back the rubbish back to the shops. Sometimes you see them at the vending machines.6) Every time you pay cash for something you'll get back a lot of coins. Yeah you guys were right. We always had to try to get rid of those coins when making purchases.7) The red maple leaves were incredibly and unbelievable red during the peak season in Kyoto. We were soooo amazed by it. Not only that, trees with yellow leaves were like golden yellow and they were so beautiful.8) Japanese people are mostly polite. However, there were 2 encounters which weren't pleasant at the train station  - the 2 person at the ticket office were impatient and unfriendly.

3360,lowyat,"Another sporting scandal after our own Dato' LCW.Vanessa Mae caught fixing ski race in Slovenia to help her qualify for recent Sochi OlympicsSos:http://www.msn.com/en-my/sport/more-sports...7Ii?ocid=HPCDHPQUOTEViolinist Vanessa Mae has been given a four-year ban by the International Ski Federation for taking part in races allegedly 'manipulated' to help her qualify for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.The governing body said its hearing panel found 'to its comfortable satisfaction' that the results of a series of races in Slovenia in January were set up in order for Mae to achieve the qualifying points required to compete at the Games.Representing Thailand and competing under the name Vanessa Vanakorn, the classical violinist took part in the women's giant-slalom in Sochi and finished last out of the 67 competitors.An FIS statement read: ""After considering written submissions and testimony at a hearing on 3rd October 2014, the Hearing Panel found to its comfortable satisfaction that the results of the four ladies giant slalom races that took place on 18th and 19th January 2014 at Krvavec (SLO) were manipulated, resulting in the calculation of FIS Points that do not reflect the true performance of the competitors that participated in those events and in particular the points awarded to Vanessa Vanakorn (Mae).""FIS found the races in Slovenia were organised at the request of Mae's management company and the Thailand Olympic Committee in order to enable her to meet the qualifying criteria.DiscrepanciesIn July, the Slovenian Ski Association suspended four of its officials and announced an investigation into alleged improprieties regarding the results of the races concerned.FIS upheld the Slovenians' findings, revealing that the results lists of two giant-slalom races which took place on January 19 included the name of a competitor who was not present.Another competitor was placed second in one race despite falling, and her finishing time is understood to have been adjusted by over 10 seconds.Among a number of other discrepancies, FIS found that the weather conditions were so bad that the races concerned would, in usual circumstances, have been cancelled.Ranking points accrued by all competitors in the respective races have been annulled. FIS confirmed that without the points in question, Mae would not have been eligible to compete in Sochi.",,,,,,,,,,,,

3362,lowyat,"http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/winter-olympics/25802907 Violinist Vanessa Mae is set to ski for Thailand at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, which start next month.Mae, a keen skier since childhood, has been competing as Vanessa Vanakorn using her father's surname.She raced four times in Slovenia at the weekend in a last-ditch bid to meet the qualifying standard.  Manager Giles Holland, speaking on behalf of Mae, told the BBC: ""It would appear that she's done it. She's done it by a whisker, but she's done it.""""Vanessa Mae has unofficially qualified for the Olympic Games, "" added Marko Rudolf, a Slovenian masters skier with links to the committee that organised the races.Under current Olympic qualification rules, countries with no skier ranked in the world's top 500 may send one man and one woman to the Games - to compete in slalom and giant slalom - if those athletes meet a second set of criteria.Thailand has no skiers ranked in the world's top 500 for any Alpine discipline. To meet the second criteria, Mae had to produce an average of 140 points or fewer over five recognised races.Athletes earn points on an inverse scale based on their performance, so the fewer points an athlete has, the better they are.In 1990, the International Olympic Committee brought in what became known as the 'Eddie the Eagle Rule', which requires Olympic hopefuls to place in the top 30%, or the top-50 of competitors, whichever is less, in international events.The British Olympic Association has much stricter selection criteria and will only put forward athletes who achieved a top-30 place in the FIS World Cup standings during the qualification period, or they must meet other strict specifications.Vanessa-MaeMae says she has wanted to be a ""ski bum"" since she was 14Mae's bid went down to the wire. Results on the official website of FIS,  the world governing body, show she dipped under the 140-mark average thanks to strong results in a series of four back-to-back giant slalom races in Slovenia on Saturday and Sunday.The 5ft 3in 35-year-old even raced in a national junior championships, in which she was more than 14 years older than any other entrant, as time ran out.The world governing body must still confirm Mae's place at the Games when the final points lists are published, a process expected to begin on Monday.In the latest rankings, Mae is 3,166 in the world in giant slalom.Mae has long harboured an ambition to compete at the Winter Olympics.She announced her bid to qualify for Sochi 2014 as early as mid-2010, telling the Daily Telegraph:  ""It has been my dream and I am hoping people will accept I just want to give it my best.""To even get to the Olympics, I have to qualify for the 2013 World Championships and the standard is high.""I am taking a plunge. I am British, but realistically there is no way I could represent my own country.""Because my natural father is Thai, they have accepted me.""BBC presenter Graham Bell, who competed for Great Britain at five Winter Olympics, understands the logic of someone of Mae's standard being able to compete.But he believes that the BOA is right to have its own stringent qualification rules.He said: ""It's great that she seems to have got less than 140 points required.""It's about getting representation for countries that aren't considered Winter Sports nations. They don't want the Winter Olympics to become too European and North American dominated.""It's difficult to compare the standard but 17-year-olds in their first year of competition would be disappointed if they didn't score less than 140.""We should never lower our qualifying criteria. The BOA have produced incredible teams in the summer Games over the last few years and we're sending the strongest team that we've had for a long time to the Winter Olympics.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

3479,lowyat,"QUOTE(loui @ Apr 10 2015, 04:49 PM)Details Desciption in How Insurance & Claims Works - Can be Download in PDF FormatI have seen many people posted accident related questions. Will try to compile and help out. Any questions will be answer in the 1st post. Won't guarantee 100% accuracy but I will try to answer as correct as I know. Please tag my name with your question in case I miss outClaim claims guide from insurance companyMSIGMCIS ZurichAm GeneralAllianzEtiqaPacific & OrientAxa AffinAIGTokio MarineBerjaya SompoKurnia/Am GeneralLonpacMPI GeneraliPersatuan Insurans Am MalaysiaQ : What happen when I involve in an accident?A : Don't move your vehicle first, get down, take photo from all angles, make sure all the silent evidences (debris, brake mark, blood stain...) that support your version are clearly taken and most important, vehicle plate number can be easily seen in the photos.Q : What's nextA : Call the police if the accident is serious and wait for police to arrive to scene. If is minor accident, just proceed to the nearest police stationQ : There is a tow truck guy approach me to help out and ask me to sign a letter. Should I allow him to tow & sign the letter?A : Insurance company offered free towing service usually within 40KM distance. Ask tow truck guy nicely(most of them are thugs), whether they are insurance appointed tow truck company. If no, refuse their service and don't sign any document. Call your insurance hotline and ask for a towing service. However some insurance company does cover up to RM200 transportation fees.Q : I am not happy with the way tow truck guy force me into signing the agreement, using them and charged me expensively. What can I do? A : Tow trucks are governed by Automobile Association Malaysia. AAM clearly listed  fix rate in their website. If you dislike the way they conduct their service or price is exorbitant, you may call up and complaint. [attachmentid=4438947]Q : What if both of us decided not to claim insurance, should we still lodge police reportA : On safe side, I still advise you to lodge police report, as you never knew what is on other's mind. They might change their mind and report later and you will be slap with RM300 compound for lodging police report late. Just in case, lodge police report with detail description of the vehicle but left out the vehicle number. For example, ""saya terlanggar sebuah m/kereta no tidak diketahui, jenis Proton Saga berwarna putih"". This is to avoid other hit & run case that happen on the same day to blame on you.Q : What if I give him some money as compensation, can he still claim against my insuranceA : Yes. Hence don't bother to pay any cash compensation as the other party can still claim against your insurance.Q : Should I pay the police compound/saman despite the other side is at faultA : It is up to your discretion. However to challenge a compound/saman, you need to attend to court to explain yourself, which some find it tedious. Many didn't realized that in your insurance policy, insurance company will pay legal costs incurred up to a maximum of RM2,000.00 for defence of any charge including the charge of causing death by driving the Motor Vehicle(other than murder). If your accident has resulted in many casualties and injuries, just rang up or send a letter to the insurance company, they are more then willing to engage lawyer to defence you for free as your compound/saman will greatly affect them if the other parties are claiming. Q : I knock into object (tree, divider, lamp post). Can I claim under OD? Do I need make a police report?A : Normal circumstance, not required. You just send your car to panel workshop, fill up claim form and workshop will proceed from there.Q : What if the object's owner sue me for the damage of the said object?A : You need to lodge police then, forward a copy of notice of claim served to you to your insurance company and let them handle on behalf. You insurance company will pay on your behalf.Q : How to make a claimA : There are mainly 4 types of claim. Own Damage Claim (OD), Own Damage Knock for Knock (OD-KFK), Third Party Property Damage Claim (TPPD) & Third Party Bodily Injury Claim (TPBI). Will not go further since someone did explain further in the other thread Q : How to make an OD(vehicle repair) claim A : You can do it only if you bought comprehensive policy. Sent your car to a panel workshop. You can check from them by demanding appointment letter from the insurance company or just call up the hotline to confirm so. Never send your vehicle to non panel workshop as you will have difficulties to claim and end up incurred cost for transferring to another panel workshop. From there, the workshop will settle it for you.Q :Insurance company refuse to pay my OD claimA : Under insurance policy, insurance company is entitle to deny you claim if 1. drunk2. under drug influence3. involve in illegal activities (ie. rempit) or motor sport competition (ie. rally)4. war, act of terror & riot5. natural cause (ie. flood, earthquake, landslide...)6. no licenseQ : I was told to pay compound for RM400 before they allow my OD claimA : Insurance policy has clause which stated that if the driver is below 21 years old or holding license L/P or is not named in schedule, they will have to pay RM400. Something like saman for allowing incompetent driver to drive the car.Q : What do you mean for allowing driver not named in schedule to driveA : While buying insurance, the policy will have column to put names of people who regularly use the vehicle. Each name cost around RM10. If you did not register the name in the policy, you are deemed to be ""not named in schedule"".Q : I was told that I can't claim against a m/cycle and public transport. Is it true?A : False, you can't claim against m/cycle and public transport through OD-KFK procedure but you can still go ahead to initiate a TPPD claim.[attachmentid=6433377]Q : Can I initiate TPPD claim personallyA : Yes. Refer to this sample letter and attached all relevent documents and send it to insured company of third party vehicle. Q : I went on to initiate TPPD claim against the public transport as per your advise but why my claim is rejected?A : First of all, call the claim assessor to find out the reason. In many circumstances, lay man like us will ask the workshop to do for us. Note that workshop staff is also lay man like you. They might proceed to initiate the claim via OD-KFK method instead of TPPD. Insurance company has no right to reject your TPPD claim unless both of you are disputing on the fact of the case. Note that if once you have commence OD claim against your own insurance, you have deem give up the right to claim against another vehicle. Q : Can I claim through OD-KFK if the third party fail to lodge police report. A : Yes. Apart from normal documents like police report and Police Investigation Result(must show third party compounded for traffic offences), you need to sign statutory declaration(SD) to affirm how the accident occurred. SD can be done through commissioner of oath. Q : How do I know whether I am entitle to OD-KFK claim?A : Different insurance companies have different methods but there is a standard requirement for it. 1st, both you and the other vehicles hold comprehensive private car policies. 2nd, police has clearly find the other parties at fault and has compounded him. Just make sure when you send your car to workshop, tell them precisely that you want to do an OD-KFK claim. Workshop staff will guide you through since it is quite common practice.Q : Will I be compensate for the period which my vehicle is in midst of repairingA: You can do it provided you claim through TPPD method. It is term as ""loss of use"". Amount is base on the type of vehicles & engine capacity. Note that period of compensation starts from the day the insurance company's appointed adjuster confirm the damage till the day of the vehicle has been fully repair.[attachmentid=4438144] Q : I am not satisfied with the offer for ""loss of use"". What can I do?A : The amount & duration stated above are merely a guideline from PIAM. Hence it is no legally binding to insured/you. To enable you to claim more, you have to rent a car from a registered car rental company. Only receipt from registered car rental company will be entertain. Or alternatively, if you have file your case in court, get your lawyer to argue for you. Sometimes judge might allowed if you managed to convince him.Q : How to make an injury claimA : You can only make an injury claim against the other vehicle that knock into you. You can either do it personally or get a lawyer to do for you.Q : What is the different between getting a lawyer and do it personallyA : If you get a lawyer to do for you, they will take a cut from your claim. Market rate is around 30%. If you win, they take their cut. If you lose, you don't have to pay anything to them. The good part in getting a lawyer is that they will handle from A to Z  and they will try to get as much as possible since they know roughly how much you can get.Q : How much can I get for my injuryA : In injury claim, 2 things determine the claim amount. The type of injury itself and liability. You can download the compendium for personal awards here. Q : What is liabilityA : Liability simply mean who is wrong/right. In accident case, liability affect the claim. Let's say you are 30% wrong and the other vehicle is 70%. For a claim worth RM10,000, you will get 70% (RM7,000). Hence the more you can proof that the other party is at fault, the more you get. That goes back to the 1st Q&A where taking photos after the accident is essential as to proof that fault is on other side.Q : What if I am totally at faultA : You simply don't get anything if you are at fault however insurance company will offer you ex-gratia (saguhati) offer to avoid dragging the matter and incurred cost engaging lawyer.Q : Do you have sample letter on how to claim personally?A : Sample (required documents are stated in the sample letter)Q : What if the other vehicle don't have insurance?A : You can still claim but against the driver personally. But you will have tough time to get money from him if he is poor. However if the vehicle is belongs to a company, by all means, get a judgement in court and demand him to pay, failing which, wind up his company. As for the unlucky one, government has set up ""MOTOR INSURERS BUREAU MALAYSIA"" to allow victim to get some ex-gratia compensation if the other vehicle does not possess valid insurance coverage. The downside is, they will only pay nominal sum. For example, a RM10,000 claim, they will pay you RM1,000 ~ RM2,000 (depend on your negotiation skill). Still it is better then nothing. Address as below.MOTOR INSURERS BUREAU MALAYSIA      3RD FLOOR, WISMA PIAM                150 JALAN TUN SAMBANTHAN            50470 KUALA LUMPUR                MALAYSIA               Q : Lawyer offer me friendly cash loan, saying that they will deduct from the money I win. Should I take it?A : I would suggest not to unless you are in financial difficulties. Mainly 2 reasons. 1st, they charge registered money lending [email protected] long rate interest. 2ndly once you took the money, you will have hard time to change to another lawyer if this one is not doing their job properly. Q : I involved in an accident and has lodge police report. The injured party is filling the claim in court. Do I need to attend court?A : Yes. Police report is useless in court if the maker(you) fail to testify in open court. Most insurance companies have clause in their policy that allows them to ""compound"" you for failing to testify. Whether they would exercised the clause is highly doubtful.Q : I attended the court everytime I was told to. However my case gets postpone many times. This is wasting my time and energy, what should I do?A : Talk to the lawyer in charge, ask them whether it is your turn in the next date. You, as the defendant, are usually listed as the last person to testify after Plaintiff and policeman. Find out whether both of them have testify. You can also tell them that you don't have transport. Insurance company will usually arrange transportation for you and if you are firm enough, you can ask for some token of compensation to attend court. Q : What if I failed to attend court?A : Your police report will not be taken into account and insurance company will lose the case. In this event, insurance company has the right to claim ask you to pay back all the money incurred on ground of non-cooperation. However chances of them exercising the right is subjective.Q : I don't think I am at fault. I want to challenge police compound/summon. What should I do A : How to challenge police compound/summonAdd On Question Q : Do you happen to have a list of recommended insurance companies?A : There are pro and con of each insurance company. Bigger companies have bigger network of workshop, however their claiming process it much slower due to volume. If you are staying outside big city, I suggest you to it from bigger companies.

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处 😍付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal Kad 😍Membuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan. Di samping itu, ia berpotensi meningkatkan bilangan pelanggan anda. Di samping itu, sesetengah pelanggan lebih suka membayar menggunakan kad kerana ia menyediakan jejak audit atas perbelanjaan mereka.Menjadi KompetitifMendapatkan terminal pembayaran akan menjadikan perniagaan anda lebih kompetitif, atau sekurang-kurangnya setanding dengan persaingan anda daripada segi kaedah pembayaran yang tersedia untuk pelanggan.

And as long as I pay everything back by the end of the month it should be fine right?Yeah you should keep it under 33%. Going over it will drop your credit score significantly even if you pay it off in full. I emailed Experian about my recent issue and they said it's Maybank's side which is baffling since it means they never bothered to update the proper outstanding to CCRIS.   I wouldn't really recommend Maybank unless you want the cashback since it has higher SST due to the 2 cards they give you but iirc you can also apply for the other cards (like the Ikhwan for petrol/groceries cashback) with a lower than 5k FD. It's just the M2Gold cards that need 5k minimum. You can find more information on their threads. Most if not all the other banks also offer CCs for pledged FDs so you're not limited to Maybank at all. The ones that have active promos for this that I know of are Affin and Hong Leong. The Affin Duo is pretty good as well since you can get cashback for topping up ewallets.",,,,,,,,,,,,

3630,lowyat,"QUOTE(red streak @ Mar 22 2021, 11:51 PM)Investment has nothing to do with credit score...it won't help him there. He just needs to pledge FD for a credit card and it'll improve his credit score as long as he keeps the utilization low. Even if he doesn't use it at all, just having a credit card active will boost his credit score up to a certain tier as long as he doesn't close it. A higher limit means he can roll the balance every month and pay it off at the last second to improve cashflow. This won't work as well if he has a higher usage which is over 33% of his credit limit since it'll drop his credit score even if he pays it off in full every due date.Somewhat on topic since it relates to an issue I've had recently. I'm not sure when the CCRIS history updates every month so maybe someone with more experience can chip in there since I've noticed that paying off 2 weeks early didn't do squat since Experian combined both months' balances into one for this month and dropped my credit score even though the actual utilization is way below 33% on my Visa because I paid it off early.  According to the website the CCRIS should update on the 15th. I paid the previous statement outstanding on the 3rd and yet somehow on 19th (when Experian updated my report) it still combined my previous statement balance (fully paid 2 weeks prior) with the outstanding. I don't understand where the issue is   Of course. You don't need income if you pledge FD. Just make sure you don't get an idiot handling your application. Sure kena reject one if they apply through income instead of FD... Otherwise 100% confirm lulus.It's a credit card. It's not even remotely close to being a debit card. This is called secured credit. The bank is extending a line of credit to you because you have an asset backing that credit. The FD is basically not even in the equation unless you fail to make multiple payments in which case the bank will liquidate your FD to pay off your outstanding balance. In a way it's the safest way to leverage debt since both parties basically have no risk. It's the same story with certain business loans for SMEs. Some companies won't normally qualify for certain loans which is why they pledge FD in order to get credit from banks.No. Those are just normal FDs. FDs need to be pledged in order to qualify for a credit card or a loan. That means you can't uplift it online and you need to go to a branch to cancel the CC and free up your FD again. Otherwise anyone with FD would qualify for a credit card regardless of their income. Malaysia isn't like the US where anyone with a pulse can get a credit card. BNM is pretty strict with the requirements, i.e - 2k minimum income for the shittiest cards like Aeon and the credit limit being 2x your monthly income if you make below a certain level.Thanks, I'll try to go to Maybank next week and check if they can offer me a cc for pledging fd.

Just spend 2 minutes login into your hlb account on your chrome and see it for yourself. Why do you want to waste 2 minutes typing this reply instead of trying it and then only fcuk me when it didn't work. I'm not sure whether it's because the change to be connect or duitnow but my settings is gone too. I can't even transfer 20k to my hlebroking account after adjusting the limits in the app. Just login with chrome and there will be a lot more limits to set. There's separate limits for duitnow, ibg, 3rd party hlb, hlebroking, qr, and so many more. The app is still inferior.Funny thing is you complain cs is rubbish but when other people give suggestions, you brush it off saying cs already reset for me. Didn't you reply here because cs knew shit?Dont use your own judgement to value me. The settings that you mentioned, I have tried all and it did not work.I believe the HLB app must have its limit for the app for certain users. It happened to Maybank as well before they lifted it.. .FUX again!I am not stupid for not checking all the settings!

So you see your investment value grow as profits increase.2) on the 9th is when Eastsprings start payout their dividends, so what they do is subtract the profit from NAV to get money for dividend payment, so NAV goes down (value goes down) on 10th, and then the dividends are paid out based on the number of units you own. These dividends are then reinvested to buy new units at the lower NAV. So your value ""drops"" slightly but you actually now have more units then before, so in reality you've already profiting.3) Repeat step #1 and 2#4) You're actually profiting based on increasing number of units you get as StashAway Simple keeps reinvesting  Don't bother about the MYR/USD tab if you only invest in Simple, Simple is strictly MYR only, so no worries about USD (any difference in value you see in MYR/USD tab is based on current currency exchange rate, which goes up and down, since recently MYR value tank it gives false info that you're losing money on USD tab).MYR/USD only becomes relevant if you invest in SAMY's portfolios because they're ETFs traded in USDThanks for shedding some light  QUOTE(bourse @ Mar 26 2021, 03:44 PM)Stashaway Simple = Eastspring Investments Islamic Income Fundhttps://www.fsmone.com.my/funds/tools/factsheet?fund=MYESIIF» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «https://www.stashaway.my/simpleIs StashAway Simple™ risky?This is an investment, so there is a level of risk, but it’s incredibly low.

It has the largest nickel reserves in the world, a key raw material used to manufacture batteries.“Brunei, too, has recently unveiled its EV policy, setting targets to have 60% of its sales be electric by 2035,” revealed Liaw.“In Vietnam, Vinfast which is the country’s EV flagship manufacturer (scooter, bus, vehicles manufacturing) is set to embark on exporting its models worldwide.”Based on its analysis, Maybank IB Research expects (i) EV’s penetration rate (currently at an embryonic stage of 4%) to super-charge at a growth rate of five times to 20% by 2025; (ii) EV-to-ICEV (internal combustion engine vehicle) sales to reach parity (1:1) by 2030; and (iii) EVs to outsell ICEVs from 2035.“The EV adoption could accelerate as (i) total cost of ownership (TCO) for EVs fall over time due to technological breakthrough and rising economies of scale, (ii) EV infrastructure expands; and (iii) the millennial generation adopts EVs.Prospect-wise, Maybank IB Research foresees a greater EV adoption at the two-wheeler (2W) segment in the ASEAN market for it already has a ready-made commercial solution, ie smart batteries (swaps & share) and infrastructure.Moreover, it is easily deployed and capable of addressing range anxiety issues, charging infrastructure availability and upfront capital cost concerns.The 2W and 4W market share in ASEAN which has a population of 673 million people (9% of global population) is 220 million units and 40 million units respectively.“This would appeal to the mass market, especially those in the rural areas,” justified the research house.“Meanwhile, ASEAN should look at China and pure-EV companies for EV opportunities/partnership/investment and pursue green technology/projects (hydrogen) at the same time.” – March 31, 2021 https://focusmalaysia.my/markets/as-ev-sets...dustry-laggard/",,,,,,,,,,,,

4195,lowyat,"Need a Mortgage Loan? Good Luck. Lenders Are Tightening Standards. https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mortgage-m...355802?mod=e2twQUOTEThe mortgage market is humming, but getting approved for a home loan is as difficult as it has been in years.Mortgage credit availability, a measure of lenders’ willingness to issue mortgages, is near its lowest level since 2014, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, or MBA.The tight lending environment illustrates a growing cleavage in the mortgage market: More home loans are being made than almost ever before, but they are going almost exclusively to borrowers with pristine credit histories and sizable down payments. Borrowers with credit qualifications that fall just outside the stellar category are finding fewer lenders willing to approve their applications. A segment of borrowers who would have qualified for a home loan early last year are now out of luck, deemed too much of a credit risk.“Because mortgage credit is more difficult to obtain, it is a more competitive environment overall,” said Dr. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.About 70% of mortgages issued in 2020 went to borrowers with credit scores of at least 760, up from 61% in 2019, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The median credit score of borrowers approved for mortgages reached 786 in the fourth quarter of 2020, up from 770 during the same period in 2019.Americans who want to break into the housing market this spring face plenty of other challenges. Home prices tend to fall in a slowing economy, but they have jumped during the coronavirus pandemic, keeping many families out of home ownership.Home prices are increasing at the fastest pace in 15 years, propelled by a record-low supply of homes for sale and a flood of well-off workers looking for second homes or space for home offices. The median existing-home price topped $300,000 last summer and has stayed there ever since.And mortgage rates, while still historically low, have risen meaningfully from last year’s record-setting lows, pushing monthly payments higher for would-be buyers.The availability of mortgage loans plummeted as much as 35% year over year in 2020, when lenders wanted to protect themselves from making loans to borrowers who might lose jobs during the pandemic. The MBA’s mortgage credit index has drifted higher since last fall but remained about 31% lower in February than the same time last year.“In one week last spring, jobless claims were in the millions,” said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree. “A borrower who was fine one week could be a much riskier borrower the next week.”Lenders’ concerns about the financial stability of borrowers prompted them to increase verification of employment and income. Some borrowers were asked to sign statements affirming that they had no intention of requesting forbearance after being approved for a mortgage. Some lenders are asking that documents used in mortgage applications, such as bank statements and pay stubs, be no older than 30 days, where they once allowed them to be 60 days older or more.Stricter credit requirements appeared most clearly at either end of the mortgage market. The average credit score for borrowers approved for Federal Housing Administration loans rose to 672 in the fiscal year 2020, up from 666 in 2019. FHA loans typically have lower incomes and smaller down payments.At the same time, lenders upped requirements for jumbo mortgages, which tend to go to well-off buyers. Jumbo mortgages are too big to be sold to government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so banks often keep them on their own books and bear the risk of default.Jeanne Griffin’s local credit union in Minnesota denied her mortgage application earlier this year. She said she was told her 713 credit score and the fact that her student loans were in pandemic-related forbearance disqualified her.“They said if I had applied a year ago, I would have been approved,” said Ms. Griffin, who has close to $20,000 saved for a down payment.The credit union encouraged her to begin making student-loan payments and pay off about $4,000 in credit-card debt before reapplying.The meteoric growth of home prices has made some lenders reluctant to take on first-time home buyers or others they view as slightly risky. Lenders who were comfortable offering mortgages of $300,000 or $320,000 to borrowers with good-but-not-great credit histories might not be willing to lend the $350,000 or more now required to buy the same property.Loan officers and underwriters weigh a handful of variables when determining whether to approve a mortgage application: employment history, income source, credit score and debt level, among others.Are you looking to buy a house for the first time? Share your experience below.Strict lending requirements play an important role in keeping the housing market healthy. Making sure that borrowers can afford mortgage payments is key to limiting defaults. Ultraliberal lending policies, including loan approvals for people with spotty income histories or mountains of debt, helped spark the 2008-09 financial crisis.Lending standards are unlikely to expand meaningfully until housing demand ebbs, economists said. The dearth of homes for sale means lenders can select only the best from an abundance of applications.Still, credit requirements should loosen slightly this year as interest rates rise, drying up refinancing, said Mike Fratantoni, the MBA’s chief economist.“Since lenders aren’t being flooded with calls to refinance, more of their resources can be used to reach out to first-time buyers for purchases,” Mr. Fratantoni said.Refinance loans are expected to comprise 46% of the mortgage market in 2021, down from 59% in 2020, according to the MBA.",,,,,,,,,,,,

All the boxes were sent by the same person with the same mobile phone number in Chonburi province, while the recipient’s address is in Tachileik town in Myanmar.Officials tracked down the persons who had dropped the boxes off at the company and arrested Manokorn (last name withheld), aged 30 years, a local of Mae Sai, and Songsak (last name withheld), the driver of the van that carried the boxes.Both suspects reportedly said they were hired by another person to drop the packages off and that they did not know of the contents in the boxes.Officials are gathering evidence to track down the sender as well as the recipient, while the two suspects were initially charged with possessing unregistered ammunition and explosives. - The Nation/Asia News Network",,,,,,,,,,,,
4210,lowyat,"Thailand pushes back thousands fleeing Myanmar as death toll surpasses 500Bangkok (CNN)Thailand has reportedly pushed back more than 2,000 people attempting to flee neighboring Myanmar following a series of air strikes carried out by the ruling junta in the southeast of the country. Activist group the Karen Information Center said 2,009 people are now internally displaced and hiding in the jungle, having been forced back into Myanmar shortly after crossing the border with Thailand.Thousands of people fled their homes in Myanmar's southeastern Karen state Sunday, after Myanmar's military jets carried out a bombing raid on villages controlled by an ethnic armed group. The Karen National Union (KNU), which holds large swathes of territory in the borderlands with Thailand, had overrun an army post near the border, killing 10 people, Reuters reported.The reported influx of people fleeing into neighboring Thailand marks a new phase in the deepening crisis for Myanmar, which was thrown into turmoil when the military seized power in a coup on February 1 and ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The airstrikes follow a bloody military crackdown over the weekend that was widely condemned internationally. At least 114 people were reportedly killed by the junta's security forces on Saturday, in the deadliest day since protests against Gen. Min Aung Hlaing's military regime began two months ago. Myanmar security forces have killed at least 510 people since the coup, with 14 shot dead on Monday including children and young people, advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said.'We don't want to have any influx into our area'.The KNU said 3,000 people crossed the Salween River into Thailand, fleeing the military's aerial bombardments, and 2,000 were pushed back. Activist group the Karen Women's Organization (KWO), which operates within Karen state and refugee camps in Thailand, confirmed the air strikes had forced 10,000 people in the state from their homes, and 3,000 had crossed into Thailand. CNN has not been able to reach Thai authorities for comment, but Reuters cited Thichai Jindaluang, the governor of Thailand's Mae Hong Son province, denying refugees were being pushed back.When CNN reached out to Thailand's Foreign Ministry, they directed us to a statement published by local media from the ministry spokesman, Tanee Sangrat, saying, ""Those reports cite information solely from non-official sources without confirming the facts from official sources on the ground which affirmed that no such pushback took place.""On Tuesday, Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said officials had not forced refugees back to Myanmar, but they had spoken with some of the people who had entered Thailand.""After we asked questions (such as) what are their problems in your country, they said, 'there's no problem.' So, since there is no problem, can they just return home for the time being? We didn't force them (to return) with guns, we even shook hands and blessed them good luck,"" Prayut said in a media briefing. ""We have to take care of them based on humanitarian principle. We have a lot of experience... There is no way we will push them back if the fighting is still ongoing. But if there is no fighting now, can they return to their home?""On Monday, Prayut said his government did not want refugees to cross the border but were preparing for a potential influx. Myanmar is a 'conflict zone'Thailand has hosted tens of thousands of refugees in nine main camps along its border with Myanmar for three decades, following armed conflicts, human rights abuses and persecution of ethnic minorities by the Myanmar military. Most of those who crossed the border over the weekend are from Mu Traw district, where the bombing has been concentrated. Many of those are people who have already fled their homes and are living in the Ei Tu Hta displacement camp. Photos provided to CNN by the KNU purport to show Myanmar refugees being denied entry into Thailand. And video shot by a Karen villager and published by Reuters showed refugees boarding boats under the watch of Thai soldiers.Armed rebel groups have been fighting the Myanmar military on and off for the past 70 years in the country's ethnic states but fighting in some areas has increased since the February 1 coup.The KNU said three civilians were killed in the strikes, which began on Saturday and continued into Monday. Military jets also killed at least two members of the KNU militia Saturday. David Eubank, founder of the relief organization Free Burma Rangers, said it was the first time in 20 years that airstrikes had been carried out in the area. Despite the government's denials, several human rights groups have criticized the Thai authorities.""Forcibly sending people back into a conflict zone amounts to refoulement and is against international refugee law,"" said the European Karen Network, a group of Karen communities from several countries in Europe, in a statement Monday. sos",,,,,,,,,,,,

(The older you are, the more you’ll have to pay to due the higher risk of dying to disease or dying generally)Essentially when you start off your insurance young, you pay a lower premium whether it’s investment link or standalone.However, standalone / term policies premium payment is incremental every 5 years until the age 60+ whereby you’ll pay an incremental yearly.For an investment link, if you start later, you’ll pay a higher premium than when you’re younger because you need more $ for your account value within your policy to grow via investment overtime to fund the future cost of insurance when you’re much older.The benefit of enrolling in an investment link policies compared to just term policies is that the benefits are usually much more better and you get to include riders within your policy that is beneficial for you in the long term such as waiver of premium (if you succumb to total permanent disability or critical illness, the insurance company continues to pay on your behalf on your yearly premium while you’re probably unable to work for a period of time due to your illness/disability).Then again if you still think term insurance is all you need, by all means go ahead, just don’t complain why you didn’t get a more comprehensive plan when the times come.and the total coverage goes up to millions yup while most term only 150k/200k.in fi.life AXA launch something decent it's cheap but the moment you hospitalized before you can't get it basically. for now the MAYBANK one I'll be keeping to 80. at least it's adorable up to 80 year old.",,,,,,,,,,,,

4424,lowyat,"Hi all, Looking to buy my first home, currently booked 2 properties, each one is within my affordability range based on informal pre-check with bank:Property A: Developer soft launch, no confirmation on lot number. First come first serve, whoever submits Loan Offer letter first gets their preferred lot. If I don't get preferred lot, can refund. Property B: Is backup for (A), confirmed lot. Just prefer (A), location-wise. Currently going thru loan check with a few banks for (A), have yet to initiate any loan check with banks for (B). I'm not looking to purchase both properties, just one. I have not signed any loan acceptance letter. Questions:1. If I submit documents to check for loan with banks for both (A) + (B) almost at the same time, and maybe even same bank, will it affect the outcome of my loan application/check?2. Or say if I have received an LO for (A) from e.g. Maybank, would that jeopardize my application with Maybank for (B)? (Since the combined amount of both properties would be beyond allowable limits).

While there are many e-commerce sites in the UK dedicated to artisan cookware, it was difficult to find one based in Malaysia.The couple incorporated their company in July 2019 and three months later, Queenspree.com was launched, featuring only one brand.Since then, the website has grown to accommodate five brands, attracted 50,000 active visitors and recorded a healthy profit in its first year of incorporation.The e-commerce outfit also partnered with Hoolah, GrabPay and Maybank to provide zero interest instalment plans for up to 12 months.Unfortunately, three months after launching, the pandemic hit, disrupting businesses and wreaking workflow.Fortunately for the couple, their business focused on digital automation early on and that helped them weather oncoming challenges.As Rahman was by profession an engineer, he envisioned an “Amazon.com-like” system to process orders efficiently.However, level-headed Rafiza the accountant quickly reminded him that they do not have that luxury.Undeterred, they reverse-engineered a fulfilment system from online references, which gave them their first reliable system.It does the job well, even helping them increase their fulfilment capacity and process orders received before 11am within the same day.Apart from being financially constrained, being a small e-commerce player also posed many challenges, especially when it comes to collaboration.At one point, the couple wanted to automate their same-day delivery service but were not able to receive a positive response from delivery companies.Having no other option, they ended up writing the codes and developed the functionality themselves. Praiseworthy growth: Since its launch, Queenspree.com has expanded its reach from one brand to five, attracted 50,000 active visitors.Upon launching the new feature, Queenspree.com is able to calculate the cost of delivery based on distance and customers could select their preferred delivery slot upon checkout.Rahman and Rafiza were happy with the outcome as that feature is not offered on many other e-commerce sites.The couple believes Malaysia will see more e-commerce verticals entering the market in the coming years, similar to what they have observed in mature foreign markets.Queenspree.com considers itself as a digital alternative to the traditional departmental stores.Its lofty goal is to onboard 50 local and international brands in three years’ time.And so far the couple has secured close to RM460,000 from “angel” investors, which they aim to fuel growth and increase market awareness.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What made this unique was that besides using the local LL, USD was used in circulation as well for every day use, similar to how you can use USD or THB in Cambodia and in the early days in Vietnam and Indonesia. You could opt to pay in LL or USD. People in Lebanon also maintained their bank accounts in USD.The Greed:Here's where things got interesting. For some reason (wink wink), the interest rates in Lebanon are out of wack even though the LL is pegged to the USD. You could borrow USD from the banks at a low interest rate and deposit back into the bank in LL for a higher interest rate, hence profiting from the delta (similar to early days ASB & ASN schemes). Also one thing to note, the Lebanese economy has pretty much no exports and relied heavily on imports, tourism from neighboring Arab countries and remittances from Lebanese working abroad. For a good number of years, the local economy was artificially propped up this way.The Rumble:Now this is where things gets interesting. Power in Lebanon is shared primarily between 4 sects, the Shia, Sunni, Maronite Christians and Druids. Hariri the PM being Sunni is closely aligned with the Saudis. Shia muslims are somewhat represented by Hezbollah and Iran. Due to a deal made by Hariri and Hezbollah, the Saudis got extremely pissed till they actually arrested Hariri when he was visiting the Saudis and forced him to resign on TV. Intervention from France (Lebanon is an ex-French colony) secured his release. This is when things got interesting as at the same time the Syrian civil war is going on at the same time. Money injection to Hezb from Iran dried up, the Saudis and the Emiratis tightened the flow of money into Lebanon to punish Hezb.The Collapse:As things became more dire and in an economy where theres dual currency in circulation, the central bank suddenly started running out of USD reserves (similar to how in the 98 Asian currency crisis, Thailand, Msia, Indo all ran dry of Forex for international conversion and had to ration, ie. capital controls). Overnight the banks started imposing restrictions on how much money you could withdraw (someone mentioned opening a Forex Account in Maybank, imagine suddenly Maybank says that USD you have in your account you cannot withdraw). The only way you could withdraw money from your account was to convert the USD you have in the bank at the Official exchange rate into LL. Some banks were not that bad imposed limits like $500 or $250 a week max withdrawal, etc. This is when the black market exchange rate happened, suddenly theres a sudden demand of USD cash but too much LL chasing it, slowly the exchange rate started creeping up, 3000 > 4000 > 5000 > etc. As the run on banks for USD cash started happening, the USD reserves in the Central bank started dropping more and more until theres not enough USD to facilitate international trade, importers could not get USD to buy goods from overseas, sending the black market exchange rates soaring as ppl now started hoarding USD instead of LL.The Aftermath:Those with sources of USD, usually from family overseas or stockpilled in a safe continue to live a decent life. Those with no means of getting USD, suffer as their purchasing power keeps decreasing as the exchange rate fluctuates. The continued war in Syria and the need to support Syrian and Palestinian (yes, for 40 years there has been Palestinian refugees in Lebanon) continues to drain the economy. Compounded by smuggling by Hezb of Gov subsidized goods into Syria (petrol, diesel, flour, etc... similar to how ppl smuggle diesel, sugar and palm oil into thailand and philippines). Every sect has their own power struggles and have no incentive to reform as that would mean a change in the power structure. Also the central bank for some reason still maintains the old pegged exchange rate of 1507 which is only used in reality to purchase gov critical items like food and medicine. Officially devaluing the currency to market rates could in a way help jump start the economy to make Lebanese goods & services cheaper but its not a path their taking now. Folks are still having their life savings stuck in USD in the local banks with no foreseeable way to get that money out.Sigh, this is what happens when everyone is smartSmart at being selfish.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The only way you could withdraw money from your account was to convert the USD you have in the bank at the Official exchange rate into LL. Some banks were not that bad imposed limits like $500 or $250 a week max withdrawal, etc. This is when the black market exchange rate happened, suddenly theres a sudden demand of USD cash but too much LL chasing it, slowly the exchange rate started creeping up, 3000 > 4000 > 5000 > etc. As the run on banks for USD cash started happening, the USD reserves in the Central bank started dropping more and more until theres not enough USD to facilitate international trade, importers could not get USD to buy goods from overseas, sending the black market exchange rates soaring as ppl now started hoarding USD instead of LL.The Aftermath:Those with sources of USD, usually from family overseas or stockpilled in a safe continue to live a decent life. Those with no means of getting USD, suffer as their purchasing power keeps decreasing as the exchange rate fluctuates. The continued war in Syria and the need to support Syrian and Palestinian (yes, for 40 years there has been Palestinian refugees in Lebanon) continues to drain the economy. Compounded by smuggling by Hezb of Gov subsidized goods into Syria (petrol, diesel, flour, etc... similar to how ppl smuggle diesel, sugar and palm oil into thailand and philippines). Every sect has their own power struggles and have no incentive to reform as that would mean a change in the power structure. Also the central bank for some reason still maintains the old pegged exchange rate of 1507 which is only used in reality to purchase gov critical items like food and medicine. Officially devaluing the currency to market rates could in a way help jump start the economy to make Lebanese goods & services cheaper but its not a path their taking now. Folks are still having their life savings stuck in USD in the local banks with no foreseeable way to get that money out.",,,,,,,,,,,,

4947,lowyat,"QUOTE(TOS @ Apr 26 2021, 12:06 PM)I have not reached sifu status  Just TOS will do.To answer you questions:1. Yes, I use Transferwise and Instarem mainly. I did frequent transfer last year compared to these year because there were plenty of opportunities last year, good counters traded at sharp discount. After that as things stabilized, less transfer is done. There are other services like Sunway Money too. Refer to this thread: https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/4857608/+1602. Virtual banks are just like the typical banks you know, the only thing is, they don't have brick-and-mortar store. Everything is done online, usually via phone. I have a HKID card so I can open HK virtual banks, I am not sure if you have one. If you don't you need to wait for Malaysia or Singapore's virtual banks to start operating, then only you can enjoy their services. Malaysia's Virtual Bank discussion thread: https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/4961821 (It's called digital bank here, but the idea is the same.)The primary benefits of virtual/digital banks are that they offer better FD/deposit rates than traditional banks as they have lower overhead cost. (No need to pay hefty rents for buildings and lower manpower cost). Some banks, based on HK's experience, offer loans and eventually venture into more profitable wealth management products. As for safety, even visiting a bank to renew FD will risk getting robbed by robbers waiting outside the bank. Digital stuff are safe only if you take good care of your personal devices. There is a chance that your phone will be hacked. So, don't simply install unauthorized apps or unsafe ones etc. This goes into IT security field, I won't comment much here. 3. My plan is continue using custodian account until I accumulate enough money, then switch over to CDS account when I start working in Singapore in the future (by then I will have a SG address). You should mention about your securities account in your will anyway. Other solutions include:a. Leave behind your account details/password for the beneficiaries to login and liquidate the securities (require trust and integrity among beneficiaries)  b. Liquidate your holdings gradually towards your old age and move them into safer FD deposits. (This is for dying-of-old-age case.)c. Transfer to the beneficiaries while you are still alive (require your beneficiaries to have good financial discipline and again integrity)  It is important to remember, for US equity investors, that there will be an estate tax if your estate is greater than 60k USD. https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloi...dent-aliens.pdfHi TOS,Regarding instarem and virtual bank thread looks not updated, until 2020 only... 1) So whats the best one to use for sending 10-20k amount from MYR to SGD to TGS? i see the thread mention bigpay is best rate... i got bigpay already. thinking to open instarem or transferwise or sunway ???2) Digital bank u mentioned actually offer how many % rate for now? ambank is 2.5% for 9months.QUOTE(wongmunkeong @ Apr 26 2021, 12:33 PM)just to share - when i was with OptionXpress & TDAmeritrade US, i found:On US IRS estate taxes - under Non-Resident Alien (NRA), ie. not US-resident and not US-citizen:""...The U.S. imposes a 40% estate tax rate on U.S. assets above a $60,000 exemption threshold on assets of the deceased nonresidents.

From real people experiences (SG investor chat) Moomoo is superior to tiger. For me I will always use IBKR as I planned to increase it to USD200k and then transfer it over to pure IBKR. I will never buy from tiger or moomoo. I will only use them for free live data. I might use them if they become cheaper than pure IBKR. Right now none of them beat pure IBKR. 1.People open moomoo to get free Apple shares until promo ends. Same reason people open Tiger. Tiger is giving discount on tesla stock/free disney stock, I open tiger for real time price (something which IBKR does not have, they force you to pay for it). I am not paying for it since Tiger and Moomoo are offering it for free.Malaysian banks -> fintech -> SG bank account (un my own name) -> FAST transfer to IBKR in SGD (for free)-> convert inside IBKR at USD2.00 regardless of amount.Keep in mind TSG have minimal requirement of USD2500. If you don't have USD2500 in cash or portfolio worth there are inactivy fees. Usually no problem as your portfolio size increases over time.Once you open TSG, you just login to IBKR and carry out all your transaction from IBKR page. You never deal iwth TSG anymore aside from initial opening account2. Virtual account. For moomoo use only. You won't get actual DBS account. Only way to get real account is go to SG yourself in person.3. Malaysian banks -> fintech -> SG bank account (un my own name) -> FAST transfer to tiger or Moomoo.Some fintech takes 2-3 days. Some fintech within 1 hour done. Some within 10 minutes done.IBKR takes 2-3 hoursTiger takes like 30 mins to 1 hourMoomoo within minutesI can't comment about withdrawal for tiger or moomoo. But for IBKR is fast. I think max also 1 day.  For me I never withdraw my money. It's a one way ticket to IBKR and never come out. I use my emergency fund and whatever money I set aside to fund my life in Malaysia.3rd party transfer (fintech) to Tiger and Moomoo will be blocked and money return to you. That's why very important to have SG bank account.4. Give your username and password to trusted family.1. See my answer above.2. You can forget about virtual banks in Malaysia. There is only one which is Maybank MAE  . You cannot open virtual banks unless you are in that country working or studying. The one which can open is Transferwise but recently they close down for Malaysians. I am one of the few they didn't close so I still have my virtual bank with transferwise and it's still functioning (receiving foreign money and sending foreign money). No idea why. not complaining. Difference between virtual bank and normal banks are normal bank have lots of branch while digital banks only have one office. Digital banks are bound by same rules as banks so they cannot just cabut. All banks can be hacked. It's only as good as the user. If you simply give out OTP, get ready for it to be hacked. Again unless you are overseas or working or studying in that country, forget about virtual banks accepting you. So don't bother about FD as other country FD give like 0.5%p.a or 0.1%p.a as everyone now cut interest.   The only virtual bank you have is Maybank MAE.3. Give your username and password to trusted family.hi Sifu,thanks for all your input...1) meaning that i will use all tradings stock in us/sg/china/hk market using TGS, while still go open MooMoo for using the platform live data. --> best n cheapest method 2) yes, i got MAE, but seem no use one. no any benefits since i got maybank real acc. but heard new mymy is coming, not sure.3) FD is still good for my case, 2/3 of my $ in is FD, so if anydigital bank can get higher FD rate sure i want. only 1/3 is for investment for stocks in MY or soon overseas.4) whats your comment on fintech for money transfer? need your comment since i want save money .... bigpay/transferwise/instarem/sunway? im new to this also. currently having bigpay nia",,,,,,,,,,,,

4969,lowyat,"So I tried withdrawing money from Etoro last week and the money finally came in this week (Thank God!). At least now I truly believe that the platform is legit. Anyway, I keep a note of all my transactions (MYR : USD at the time of deposit) and I see that I lose around RM200+ per $2,000 withdrawal. i.e. Deposit $2,000 = RM8,380.65 ... Withdraw $2,000 = RM8,140.40 = RM240.25 Difference.  I thought it was the withdrawal fees, but they already deducted the $5 fee beforehand. I dont think Maybank charged me any fees for getting my money back from Etoro. If its the Exchange rate, then I cant believe the price of MYR:USD could drop so much within just 1 week.   Anybody know why its like this? I wanna keep using Etoro in the long run, but I need to find a way to mitigate this conversion loss. RM200 is like a months worth of McD already. On a side note; I would like to give a shoutout to my Etoro Account Manager, S. With how frequent everyone says that Etoro has little to no customer support, i was scared that my withdrawal would be filled with problems after I sent in the request. I got a call from my Account Manager the next day and the dude really put me at ease. He told me how long the process would take, asked me about my trading/investing preferences, informed me of some Etoro webinar programmes that I could join, and even gave me some popular trader recommendations that suit my portfolio for me to copy. Thats a great customer service experience right there. I hope he's there to stay  ",,,,,,,,,,,,

I will never buy from tiger or moomoo. I will only use them for free live data. I might use them if they become cheaper than pure IBKR. Right now none of them beat pure IBKR.

4971,lowyat,"QUOTE(J1g54w @ Apr 20 2021, 09:39 AM)where to buy GME in Malaysia?You can open an Etoro account or go with the more proper (but a bit more troublesome route) of opening an Interactive Brokers account. There's also Tiger Brokers (from Singapore) which is almost as solid as Interactive Brokers but is much easier to open for Malaysians. Local Banks like Maybank also offer US Stock Trading services...but damn expensive lah. Sure, its trusted because you're dealing with Maybank, but you'd have to rely on volume to actually make profit (have to buy very large amount of shares). IMO not suitable for small fish investors/traders. Do your research & decide which platform is right for you. The next big Catalyst is the GME meeting in June...So you have like a month or so to open an account and start buying.

Deposit and withdrawing money incur extra cost Vs using Interactive broker route. Hence the reason didn't open webull.For me, my money overseas is one time ticket.

Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security.

This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal KadMembuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan.

Trust me, I was plenty surprised when I got approved for SC JOP back when the salary requirement wasn't RM3K a month (it was one of those ""apply for the heck of it"" moments). But when I looked at my profile later in the online banking, maybe the guy fibbed a little? I dunno how that slipped through. Couldn't get Maybank CC for years (which I want mostly for the 0% installment plans), until I met a person at one of these events and told them my ""sob story"" (salary bank, but still cannot get their CC) and they helped with my application (as ""fresh grad application"" even though I was no longer one by that point). The only annoying thing about it was having to dig up my cert to send a picture of over WhatsApp to that officer. It does seem like local banks are more stringent than foreign banks...

Last year I totally clear 2 of the cards and requested for withdrawal on January 2021. After when my record in CCRIS cleared in mid Feb, I tried apply for car loan and credit card with public bank and both approved. In fact the car loan applied through CIMB was approved too but with higher interest rate so didn't go with them.The other card I cleared end of Feb.Recently tried applied for Maybank credit card and approved too.I guess if u manage to control your debt properly and clear off most of it should be no issue to apply for loans even if just withdrawn or settled AKPK.

I'm not comfortable with high PE, but I'm learning to adjust the mindset that PE valuation is everything. This has caused me lose opportunity to buy Frontken, Vitrox, QL & the likes previously. Looking at PE made me buy gloves last year, thinking they were atttractively priced according to research reports, since they were at few years' low. So, I dont' think purely looking at PE is value investing, but it's a good comparison with other stocks. On value investing, there are so many types of value investing. Basically, I like to buy during price dips. I thought I practised value investing when I bought TG last year at reasonable PE, higher than FD dividend yield, reasonable room to grow further as many sources say that gloves shortage is global. Mr Market proved that I wasn't value investing by buying gloves at peak earnings & near all time high prices. Strictly speaking, when I bought Genting last year, it wasn't value investing either, bcoz future earnings wasn't clear & stock valuation wasn't ""cheap"". Hence, I dont' think I use value investing as I don't calculate intrinsic value. I invest on what I feel comfortable with. I beg to differ on your point that the reason to buy is reason to sell. Based on that reasoning, I should sell glove companies bcause I no longer believe that they'll generate sustained heightened earnings for 1 or 2 years. But my limited experience tells me, if a company is strong, like Maybank, holding long term will eventually allow the stock to recover its price & avoid real losses. I believe my gloves will be the same. I'm ready to hold long. Maybe it differs from person to person, (I hate cutting losses) Furthermore, my observation is that, for any stock, price rocketing in too short a time compared to previous years is a ticking time bomb. Gloves in 2020-2021, KESM in 2017, GME, Datacrap recently. Ofc, traders would love to fast in fast out, but that isn't for me. My reason to buy & hold KGB are as follows. The horrible 2020 due to lockdown means 2021 should be better earnings improvement, with gradual openings. Semicon chip shortage implies KGB might benefit. I feel these reasons are what the market saw when it chased KGB from 1.60 to 2.30. I think the market is looking at companies that can improve its profits substantially in the next year, judging by share prices of others like, Aeon, Genting, Airasia, etc. Also, as mentioned earlier, if share price goes berserk suddenly, I will sell. My buying price of around2.13 going to RM4 is around 100%. That would be irrational price swing as the market expectation is too high in too short time. PS - Not a buy or sell call on any stock.

I believe my gloves will be the same. I'm ready to hold long. Maybe it differs from person to person, (I hate cutting losses) Furthermore, my observation is that, for any stock, price rocketing in too short a time compared to previous years is a ticking time bomb. Gloves in 2020-2021, KESM in 2017, GME, Datacrap recently. Ofc, traders would love to fast in fast out, but that isn't for me. My reason to buy & hold KGB are as follows. The horrible 2020 due to lockdown means 2021 should be better earnings improvement, with gradual openings. Semicon chip shortage implies KGB might benefit. I feel these reasons are what the market saw when it chased KGB from 1.60 to 2.30. I think the market is looking at companies that can improve its profits substantially in the next year, judging by share prices of others like, Aeon, Genting, Airasia, etc. Also, as mentioned earlier, if share price goes berserk suddenly, I will sell. My buying price of around2.13 going to RM4 is around 100%. That would be irrational price swing as the market expectation is too high in too short time. PS - Not a buy or sell call on any stock. But discussions are welcomed.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Those times when my tapau came without utensils and i had not enough water to wash my hands i had to go the contractor route. Break off part of the styrofoam food packaging and use it as a spoon. Best challenge was when i tapued Malay nasi campur without utensils and it came in those brown manila paper wrapping. I turned the plastic bag inside out and used it as a glove. Whatever the plastic bag had gone thru was way cleaner than my hands hahaI missed those Docker Engineer (Engineered?) pants. Dockers once had those pants with multiple compartments perfect for ppl going to site. It had the standard front and back pockets that were deeper than normal. It also had a fully zipable front compartment and a side pocket by your knees. Field guys or shoplifters wet dream i guess. I remember stuffing 555 notebooks, test pens, my scientific calculator, cigges and later my PALM down those pants. On top of my wallet and car keys. Fark it was a good set of pants, and didnt look that ugly, quite fashionable. Well worth its price pointI remember sleeping in my car from 1 up to 3 hours. Most of my work was done late at night, sometimes if' i'm too tired i pull over and take a nap. If i'm on the highway or city i pull over near a rest area, 24 hour petrol station or mamak hide all my valuables, switch off the engine, wind down the window slightly and doze away.  Remote areas had to get creative, did it once near a mosque/surau (spoiler noting happened) and also a police station in Kuala Pilah. Police actually checked on me to see if I was ok (it was a friendly encounter).  That time forget smart phones, only Samsung Blue-I or Motorola Razr. So nobody viral me as mabuk hahahFunniest specific anecdote happened either in Menara Public Bank or Maybank, i think more than 15 years ago, maybe in 05 or 06. I remember it as Public Bank, my colleague with me says it was Maybank» Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... «The building was scheduled to go for a routine power maintenance so there was gonna be a slight power outage for a few hours. As a precaution some of my customers telecoms equipment at the basement needed to be switched off. It was a routine job so when it come the time to turn on the buildings power nothing happened, or something tripped i cant remember. For half an hour they kept trying to find the root cause but no luck. The building chargemen or maintenance manager was a Malay dude. He was smoking a cigarette, took a long puff and without sounding like he was kidding told the Chinamen contractor. Hang ada mintak kebenaran boss tak? The contractor looked at him, went hmmm went off to the management office. Came out with joss sticks and prayed at the altar (Dato Kong i think) at the car park. They then did one more round of checks switched on the power and voila..it came back on. hahahhah. Damndest thing I saw. Of course me and my colleague was abit freaked out and my colleague who was malay told me...dude you wanna pray for us also? So i thought why not, took one more joss stick, prayed as well and powered up our equipment without fuss. Just like in a text book. Remember kids, those days it was modules upon modules inserted into racks upon racks that were interconnected. Powering on and off these stuff wasnt straight forward. I didnt want something supernatural pissed off at me hahahSo anyone with their own funny anecdote to share, share away. Blow water ka, reminisce about the old times ka, something funny, something sad, something insightful, I would love to hear them. Too many depressing threads these days",,,,,,,,,,,,

5341,lowyat,"QUOTE(Jingle91 @ Apr 9 2021, 08:45 AM)Hi, it actually work in other way round, BR is indeed the variable rates during the tenure, and it depend on the bank'cost of capital, so when BNM lower down the OPR, most bank will also lower down their BR. All bank will publish their BR on their website.The spread (in this case 0.7) in this case is fixed over the tenure, but PBB will only be increased it if you failed to pay for two mths or lapsed payment 3 times in a year(this is for PBB, other bank might be different), the increased rates can only be lower down to normal rates as per agreement once you settle your outstanding payments. So don't ever lapse your repayment.So PBB spread is higher compare to other bank because their BR has been the lowest in past ten year, so most of the time their total rates is still lower compare to other banks. I have been comparing my PBB loan rate with my another loan from other bank, and also with my friends loan rate from different bank. So far we don't have loan from MBB yet so can't comment much, but if it also work with BR+Spread, then TS should take in the benefit of MRTA which is inclusive in your PBB loan, instead of just looking at the final repayment. In TS case, I think MBB repayment is lower because without MRTA.For insurance, it is always better to have coverage. If you plan to have marriage or you already married and have dependent, then should take MRTA, unless your own life insurance and CI have enough coverage.the maybank also with mrta....",,,,,,,,,,,,

5364,lowyat,"First of all, I was stupid to fall for this scammer's lies.On 6 April 2021, this scammer privately contacted me via Whatsapp. The scammer got my number from one of my WTB topics.The scammer mentioned that they have Spider-Man: Edge of Time PS3 and Captain America: Super Soldier PS3 for sale. Stupidly enough, I believed that the seller does have it by sharing pics of both games. I agreed to buy both for RM100. I also asked if they have X-Men: Origins Wolverine. Again, I believed them, and agreed for another RM50. I was too excited and I transferred RM150 to that scammer's Hong Leong bank account.Details are:Scammer Name: Joan ThinPhone Number: 011-31519708Hong Leong Bank Account No.: 04551063509Maybank Account No.: 112223328981 (Thanks, melt)After that, they mentioned that it will post it to J&T Express on that day (6 April) before 5 pm. Like a moron, I said thank you. I kept sending Whatsapp messages to the scammer with no replies. Didn't pick up Whatsapp voice call, and for whatever reason, I called the direct number and it is said that it is not in service.It is embarrassing and stupid of me to believe that scammer. The first warning sign that I should have known is that the scammer does not have a Lowyat account. The second warning sign is that they do not provide their Facebook page.So TLDR, don't fall for this scammer's lies, and do not be too eager or stupid like me. It is just RM150, but it is a heavy price to pay for believing an outsider blindly. This is my first scam case, so this is a great lesson for me to not blindly transfer my money to other people. My poor judgement led to me to this, and I hope other Lowyat users do not fall for this scammer.Below are my Whatsapp screenshots if you guys are interested to read my conversation with the scammer. Thank you for reading.Regards.

In addition, it can potentially increase your customer base. In addition, some customers would prefer to pay using cards as this provides for an audit trail of their spending.Being CompetitiveGetting a payment terminal would make your business more competitive, and if not, on par with your competition in terms of payment methods available to the customers. Accepting credit and debit card gives your business an edge against someone who accepts cash-only transactions.Cashless TransactionCurrently, many people are less inclined to carry tons of cash, as it is inconvenient and could potentially be a threat to their security. Therefore, majority of the people have credit and debit cards which relieves them of this insecurity and inconvenience. This also provides assurance, that they will always have enough money to pay for the item of interest.••••••••••••••••••••••••刷卡机的好处付款 Making Payments使用刷卡机虽然会增加营业成本，却能为顾客提供更多灵活的付款选项。再者，使用刷卡机也可能会吸引更多顾客群。一些顾客喜欢刷卡付账是为了方便追查消费记录。保持竞争力 Being Competitive支付终端机能让您的生意更具竞争力，否则在付款方式方面，您将落在人后。那些接受信用卡及扣账卡支付的商家比那些只限现金交易的商家更占具优势。无现金交易 Cashless如今，许多人都不愿意带着大量现金出门，这不仅不方便，还可能危及个人安全。因此，大部分人都会使用信用卡及扣账卡，此举也可以确保他们常常有足够的钱来购物。••••••••••••••••••••••••Kenapa Menggunakan Terminal KadMembuat PembayaranWalaupun mempunyai terminal kad dalam perniagaan anda akan dikenakan kos, namun kemudahan tersebut menyediakan perniagaan dengan pilihan pembayaran yang fleksibel kepada pelanggan.

5377,lowyat,"QUOTE(TOS @ Apr 26 2021, 12:06 PM)I have not reached sifu status  Just TOS will do.To answer you questions:1. Yes, I use Transferwise and Instarem mainly. I did frequent transfer last year compared to these year because there were plenty of opportunities last year, good counters traded at sharp discount. After that as things stabilized, less transfer is done. There are other services like Sunway Money too. Refer to this thread: https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/4857608/+1602. Virtual banks are just like the typical banks you know, the only thing is, they don't have brick-and-mortar store. Everything is done online, usually via phone. I have a HKID card so I can open HK virtual banks, I am not sure if you have one. If you don't you need to wait for Malaysia or Singapore's virtual banks to start operating, then only you can enjoy their services. Malaysia's Virtual Bank discussion thread: https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/4961821 (It's called digital bank here, but the idea is the same.)The primary benefits of virtual/digital banks are that they offer better FD/deposit rates than traditional banks as they have lower overhead cost. (No need to pay hefty rents for buildings and lower manpower cost). Some banks, based on HK's experience, offer loans and eventually venture into more profitable wealth management products. As for safety, even visiting a bank to renew FD will risk getting robbed by robbers waiting outside the bank. Digital stuff are safe only if you take good care of your personal devices. There is a chance that your phone will be hacked. So, don't simply install unauthorized apps or unsafe ones etc. This goes into IT security field, I won't comment much here. 3. My plan is continue using custodian account until I accumulate enough money, then switch over to CDS account when I start working in Singapore in the future (by then I will have a SG address). You should mention about your securities account in your will anyway. Other solutions include:a. Leave behind your account details/password for the beneficiaries to login and liquidate the securities (require trust and integrity among beneficiaries)  b. Liquidate your holdings gradually towards your old age and move them into safer FD deposits. (This is for dying-of-old-age case.)c. Transfer to the beneficiaries while you are still alive (require your beneficiaries to have good financial discipline and again integrity)  It is important to remember, for US equity investors, that there will be an estate tax if your estate is greater than 60k USD. https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloi...dent-aliens.pdfHi TOS,Regarding instarem and virtual bank thread looks not updated, until 2020 only... 1) So whats the best one to use for sending 10-20k amount from MYR to SGD to TGS? i see the thread mention bigpay is best rate... i got bigpay already. thinking to open instarem or transferwise or sunway ???2) Digital bank u mentioned actually offer how many % rate for now? ambank is 2.5% for 9months.QUOTE(wongmunkeong @ Apr 26 2021, 12:33 PM)just to share - when i was with OptionXpress & TDAmeritrade US, i found:On US IRS estate taxes - under Non-Resident Alien (NRA), ie. not US-resident and not US-citizen:""...The U.S. imposes a 40% estate tax rate on U.S. assets above a $60,000 exemption threshold on assets of the deceased nonresidents. Foreign estates become subject to U.S. estate taxation with respect to their U.S.-situated assets.U.S.-situated assets include American real estate, tangible personal property, and securities of U.S. companies. A non-resident’s stock holdings in American companies are also subject to estate taxation..Certain assets that are exempt from U.S. estate tax include securities that generate portfolio interest, bank accounts not used in connection with a trade or business in the U.S., and insurance proceeds.The estate of a nonresident alien may deduct from the gross estate the value of property passing to the decedent’s surviving spouse if the spouse is a U.S. citizen or resident alien regardless of whether the spouse lives in the U.S. or abroad. However, if a spouse is also a non-resident alien, the unlimited spouse exemption does not apply....""https://www.taxesforexpats.com/articles/non...ted-states.htmlhttps://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloi...dent-aliens.pdfWhen i moved my accounts (forced) to TDAmeritrade SG - i asked TDASG when i kaput, how on estate taxes, response was, in short ""..

Thanks for the correction, 60k USD is for NRA, the 11 million+ exemption is only for domiciled US resident. My bad, I already rectified my earlier post. As for TDA SG's case, this is what I found: https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articl...duty-singapore/and estate tax (estate duty) has been removed in SG: https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Other-Taxe...ty/Estate-Duty/So I think no tax on assets in SG brokerage accounts after death for foreign persons. Correct me if I am wrong.Hi TOS/MunKeong,Actually i read twice and still not understand...... althought i can read english LOL  1) meaning if i use TGS to buy US shares more than 60k usd, i will kena tax ?2) meaning in SG buy how many k SGD shares also will not get tax?3) while for malaysia law, we buy shares n earn, need pay tax?QUOTE(Ramjade @ Apr 26 2021, 01:57 PM)1. From real people experiences (SG investor chat) Moomoo is superior to tiger. For me I will always use IBKR as I planned to increase it to USD200k and then transfer it over to pure IBKR. I will never buy from tiger or moomoo. I will only use them for free live data. I might use them if they become cheaper than pure IBKR. Right now none of them beat pure IBKR. 1.People open moomoo to get free Apple shares until promo ends. Same reason people open Tiger. Tiger is giving discount on tesla stock/free disney stock, I open tiger for real time price (something which IBKR does not have, they force you to pay for it). I am not paying for it since Tiger and Moomoo are offering it for free.Malaysian banks -> fintech -> SG bank account (un my own name) -> FAST transfer to IBKR in SGD (for free)-> convert inside IBKR at USD2.00 regardless of amount.Keep in mind TSG have minimal requirement of USD2500. If you don't have USD2500 in cash or portfolio worth there are inactivy fees. Usually no problem as your portfolio size increases over time.Once you open TSG, you just login to IBKR and carry out all your transaction from IBKR page. You never deal iwth TSG anymore aside from initial opening account2. Virtual account. For moomoo use only. You won't get actual DBS account. Only way to get real account is go to SG yourself in person.3. Malaysian banks -> fintech -> SG bank account (un my own name) -> FAST transfer to tiger or Moomoo.Some fintech takes 2-3 days. Some fintech within 1 hour done. Some within 10 minutes done.IBKR takes 2-3 hoursTiger takes like 30 mins to 1 hourMoomoo within minutesI can't comment about withdrawal for tiger or moomoo. But for IBKR is fast. I think max also 1 day.  For me I never withdraw my money. It's a one way ticket to IBKR and never come out. I use my emergency fund and whatever money I set aside to fund my life in Malaysia.3rd party transfer (fintech) to Tiger and Moomoo will be blocked and money return to you. That's why very important to have SG bank account.4. Give your username and password to trusted family.1. See my answer above.2. You can forget about virtual banks in Malaysia. There is only one which is Maybank MAE  . You cannot open virtual banks unless you are in that country working or studying. The one which can open is Transferwise but recently they close down for Malaysians. I am one of the few they didn't close so I still have my virtual bank with transferwise and it's still functioning (receiving foreign money and sending foreign money). No idea why. not complaining. Difference between virtual bank and normal banks are normal bank have lots of branch while digital banks only have one office. Digital banks are bound by same rules as banks so they cannot just cabut. All banks can be hacked. It's only as good as the user. If you simply give out OTP, get ready for it to be hacked. Again unless you are overseas or working or studying in that country, forget about virtual banks accepting you. So don't bother about FD as other country FD give like 0.5%p.a or 0.1%p.a as everyone now cut interest.   The only virtual bank you have is Maybank MAE.3. Give your username and password to trusted family.hi Sifu,thanks for all your input...1) meaning that i will use all tradings stock in us/sg/china/hk market using TGS, while still go open MooMoo for using the platform live data. --> best n cheapest method 2) yes, i got MAE, but seem no use one. no any benefits since i got maybank real acc. but heard new mymy is coming, not sure.3) FD is still good for my case, 2/3 of my $ in is FD, so if anydigital bank can get higher FD rate sure i want. only 1/3 is for investment for stocks in MY or soon overseas.4) whats your comment on fintech for money transfer? need your comment since i want save money .... bigpay/transferwise/instarem/sunway? im new to this also. currently having bigpay nia",,,,,,,,,,,,

But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. -Go on. {Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? -Two! Two! -Three! Three! -Two! Two! -Three! -Three? One? {Shudders} Three? --Three! Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, uh, number three! -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. If you like pina coladas And getting caught in the rain -Princess Fiona. If you're not into yoga -She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - -Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. -But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh. That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? {Laughs} {Groans} -Hey, wait.

You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. -Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures! {Crowd murmuring} -Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. -Exactly the way it was? -Down to the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of quest? -Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole orge trip. -Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions. -{Sniffs} They stink? -Yes - - No! -They make you cry? -No! -You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs. -No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. {Sighs} -Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers. -I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes. -You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, ""Let's get some parfait,"" they say, ""No, I don't like no parfait""? Parfaits are delicious. -No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later. -Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. -You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering. I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh And everything that you receive up yonder Is what you give to me the day I wander I'm on my way I'm on my way I'm on my way -Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's brimstone We must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither. {Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. {Laughing} -Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves. -Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. -You know what I mean. -You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me feel so much better. -Just keep moving. And don't look down. -Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. {Gasps} -Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please! -But you're already halfway. -But I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. -Shrek, no! Wait! -Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? -Oh, this? -Yes, that! -Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. {Screams} -No, Shrek! No! Stop it! -You said do it! I'm doin' it. -I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh! -That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. {Chuckles} -I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek. {Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - - Shh. -Oh, good. Me neither. {Gasps} -'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that. {Gasps} -Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. -Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess. -The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. -What makes you think she'll be there? -I read it in a book once. -Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'. {Creacing} -I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it. -Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - -Dragon! {Screams} {Gasps} {Roars} -Donkey, look out! {Screams} {Whimpering} -Got ya! {Roars} {Gasps} {Shouts} -Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! {Screaming} {Gasps} -Oh! Aah! Aah! {Gasping} {Crowls} -No. Oh, no, No! {Screams} -Oh, what large teeth you have. {Crowls} -I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - (Coughs) -I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek! {Gasps} {Whimpering} -No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! {Groans, Sighs} {Vocalizing} -Oh! Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. -Oh, that's nice. Now let's go! -But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. -Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed. -You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm. {Screams, grunts} -But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! -I don't think so. -Can I at least know the name of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek. {Cleans throat} -I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks! {Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my to-do list. Now come on! {Screams} -But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they burst into flame. -That's not the point. Oh! -Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there. -Well, I have to save my ass. -What kind of knight are you? -One of a kind. -Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. {Laughs} -I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh! {Growls} {Roaring} {Gasps} -Hi, Princess! -It talks! -Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. {Screams} {Screaming} -Oh! {Thuds} {Groans} {Roars} {Roaring} -Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon. {Fchoing} -Run! {Gasping} {Screaming} {Roaring} {Screams} {Roars} {Panting, sighs} {Whimpers} {Roars} -You did it! -You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. {Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed. -The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer. -No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st. -But how will you kiss me? -What? That wasn't in the job description. -Maybe it's a perk. -No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss. -Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love? -Well, yes. {Laughing} -You think Shrek is your true love! -What is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet. -Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. -You- - You're a- - an orge. -Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. -Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an orge. {Sighs} -Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question. You should ask him that when we get there. -But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - his pet. -So much for noble steed. -You're not making my job any easier. -I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. -Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare. Put me down! -Ya comin', Donkey? -I'm right behind ya. -Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down! -Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what happens when you find your - - Hey! {Sighs} -The sooner we get to DuLoc the better. -You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful! -And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like? -Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. {Laughs} -I don't know. There are those who think little of him. -Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the ""measuring"" when you see him tomorrow. -Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp? -No, that'll take longer. We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the woods. -Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good. -Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest. -I need to find somewhere to camp now! {Birds wings fluttering} {Grunting} -Hey! Over here. -Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess. -No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. -Homey touches? Like what? {Crashing} -A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you doing? {Laughs} -I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding. {Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. -Hey, can you tell my future from these stars? -The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for. -I know you're making this up. -No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench. -That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots. -You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it. {Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. -We? Donkey, there's no ""we"". There's no ""our"". There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. -No, do ya think? -Are you hidin' something? -Never mind, Donkey. -Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? -No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things. -Why don't you want to talk about it? -Why do you want to talk about it? -Why are you blocking? -I'm not blocking. -Oh, yes, you are. -Donkey, I'm warning you. -Who you trying to keep out? -Everyone! Okay? -Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. -Oh! For the love of Pete! -What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!"" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know. -So, uh, are there any donkeys up there? -Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. -Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there? -That's the moon. -Oh, okay. {Orchestra} {Dulcimer} -Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. -Hmph. -Ah. Perfect. {Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. --Come on, baby. I said I like it. -Donkey, wake up. -Huh? What? -Wake up. -What? -Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Uh, thanks. {Sniffs} -Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. {Belches} -Shrek! -What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs} -Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess. {Belches} -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. -{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. {Vocalizing} -La liberte! Hey! -Princess! {Laughs} -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from this green - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess! Go find you own! -Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are! -Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry Men. {Laughs} {Accordion} Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo. I steal from the rich and give to the needy. He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels Man, I'm good What a guy, Monsieur Hood Break it down I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid What he's basically saying is he likes to get - - Paid So When an orge in the bush grabs a lady by the tush That's bad That's bad When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad He's mad He's really, really mad I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart Keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start {Grunts, Groans} {Karate Yell} {Merry Men Gasping} {Panting} -Man, that was annoying! -Oh, you little- - {Karate Yell} {Accordion} {Shouting, groaning} {Chuckles} -Uh, shall we? -Hold the phone. {Grunts} Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from? -What? -That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that? -Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt! -What? Oh, would you look at that? -Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. -Why? What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay. -You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich? -Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. -Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! -{Both} Donkey! -Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. -What are the flowers for? -For getting rid of Donkey. -Ah. -Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. -Ow! Hey! Eas",,,,,,,,,,,,

Who'd want to live in place like that? -That would be my home. -Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. -I guess you don't entertain much, do you? -I like my privacy. -You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. -Can I stay with you? -Uh, what? -Can I stay with you, please? -Of course! -Really? -No. -Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please! -Okay! Okay! But one night only. -Ah! Thank you! -What are you - - No! No! -This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. -Oh! -Where do, uh, I sleep? -Outside! -Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. {Sniffles} -Here I go. -Good night. {Sighs} -I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey.

No! {Cackling} -What? -Quit it. -Don't push. {Squeaking} {Lows} - What are you doing in my swamp? {Echoing} Swamp! Swamp! Swamp! {Gasping} -Oh, dear! -Whoa! -All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! -Quickly. Come on! -No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. -Oh! {Sighs} -Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them. -Oh, gosh, no one invited us. -What? -We were forced to come here. -By who? -Lord Farquaad. -He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice. {Sighs} -All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? {Murmuring} -Oh, I do. I know where he is. -Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? -Me! Me! -Anyone? -Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me! {Sighs} -Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! {Cheering} {Twittering} -Oh! You! You're comin' with me. - All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! -On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. -Hey. Oh, oh! -I can't wait to get on the road again. -What did I say about singing? -Can I whistle? -No. -Can I hum it? -All right, hum it. {Humming} {Grunts} {Whimpering} -That's enough. He's ready to talk. {Coughing} {Laughing} {Clears throat} -Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man! -You are a monster. -I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others? -Eat me!{Grunts} -I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll - - -No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. -All right then. Who's hiding them? -Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man? -The muffin man? -The muffin man. -Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? -Well, she's married to the muffin man. -The muffin man? -The muffin man! -She's married to the muffin man. {Door opens} -My lord! We found it. -Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in. {Man grunting} {Gasping} -Oh! -Magic mirror - - -Don't tell him anything! -No! {Ginerbread man whispers} -Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? -Well, technically you're not a king. -Uh, Thelonius. -You were saying? -What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess. -Go on. {Chuckles} -So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. -Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! -And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! -So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? -Two! Two! -Three! Three! -Two! Two! -Three! -Three? One? {Shudders} Three? --Three! Pick number three, my lord! -Okay, okay, uh, number three! -Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. If you like pina coladas And getting caught in the rain -Princess Fiona. If you're not into yoga -She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - -But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. -I'll do it. -Yes, but after sunset - - -Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. -But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it. -So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. -Uh-huh. That's the place. -Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? {Laughs} {Groans} -Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek. -Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry. -Hey, you! {Screams} -Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - {Whimpering} {Sighs} {Whimpering, Groans} {Turnstile clatters} {Chuckles} {Sighs} -It's quiet. Too quiet. {Creaking} -Where is everybody? -Hey, look at this! {Clattering, whirring, clicking} Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect ...... place {Camera shutter clicks {Whirring} -Wow! Let's do that again! -No. No. No, no, no! No. {Trumpet fanfare} {Crowd cheering} -Brave knights. -You are the best and brightest in all the land. -Today one of you shall prove himself - - -All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. -Sorry about that. {Cheering} -That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. {Cheering} -Let the tournament begin! {Gasps} -Oh! -What is that? {Gasping} -It's hideous! -Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. -Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named champion! Have it him! -Get him! -Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. -Go ahead! Get him! -Can't we just settle this over a pint? -Kill the beast! -No? All right then. Come on! I don't give a damn about my reputation You're living in the past It's a new generation -Damn! {Whinnying} A girl can do what she wants to do And that's what I'm gonna do And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me Me, me, me -Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Never said I wanted to improve my station -Ah! {Laughs} And I'm always feelin' good when I'm having fun -Yeah! And I don't have to please no one -The chair! Give him the chair! And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me Me, me, me Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me, not me {Bell dings} {Cheering} {Laughs} -Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! {Shrek laughs} {Crowd gasping, murmuring} -Shall I give the order, sir? -No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! -What? -Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest. -Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures! {Crowd murmuring} -Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. -Exactly the way it was? -Down to the last slime-covered toadstool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone. -What kind of quest? -Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. -Is that about right? -Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. -I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole orge trip. -Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? -Uh, no, not really, no. -For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think. -Example? -Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions. -{Sniffs} They stink? -Yes - - No! -They make you cry? -No! -You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs. -No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. {Sighs} -Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers. -I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes. -You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, ""Let's get some parfait,"" they say, ""No, I don't like no parfait""? Parfaits are delicious. -No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later. -Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. -You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering. I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh I'm on my way from misery to happiness today Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh And everything that you receive up yonder Is what you give to me the day I wander I'm on my way I'm on my way I'm on my way -Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? -You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's brimstone We must be getting close. -Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither. {Rumbling} -Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. {Laughing} -Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers? -Oh, aye. -Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves. -Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. -You know what I mean. -You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. -I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava! -Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time. -Really? -Really, really. -Okay, that makes me feel so much better. -Just keep moving. And don't look down. -Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. {Gasps} -Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please! -But you're already halfway. -But I know that half is safe! -Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. -Shrek, no! Wait! -Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? -Don't do that! -Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? -Oh, this? -Yes, that! -Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. {Screams} -No, Shrek! No! Stop it! -You said do it! I'm doin' it. -I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh! -That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. -Cool. -So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? -Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. {Chuckles} -I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek. {Water dripping, wind howling} -You afraid? -No. -But - - - Shh. -Oh, good. Me neither. {Gasps} -'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that. {Gasps} -Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. -Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess. -The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. -What makes you think she'll be there? -I read it in a book once. -Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'. {Creacing} -I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it. -Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - -Dragon! {Screams} {Gasps} {Roars} -Donkey, look out! {Screams} {Whimpering} -Got ya! {Roars} {Gasps} {Shouts} -Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! {Screaming} {Gasps} -Oh! Aah! Aah! {Gasping} {Crowls} -No. Oh, no, No! {Screams} -Oh, what large teeth you have. {Crowls} -I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - (Coughs) -I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek! {Gasps} {Whimpering} -No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! {Groans, Sighs} {Vocalizing} -Oh! Oh! -Wake up! -What? -Are you Princess Fiona? -I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. -Oh, that's nice. Now let's go! -But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment? -Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. -Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed. -You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? -Mm-hmm. {Screams, grunts} -But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! -I don't think so. -Can I at least know the name of my champion? -Um, Shrek. -Sir Shrek. {Cleans throat} -I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. -Thanks! {Roaring} -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's on my to-do list. Now come on! {Screams} -But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did. -Yeah, right before they burst into flame. -That's not the point. Oh! -Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there. -Well, I have to save my ass. -What kind of knight are you? -One of a kind. -Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. {Laughs} -I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh! {Growls} {Roaring} {Gasps} -Hi, Princess! -It talks! -Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. {Screams} {Screaming} -Oh! {Thuds} {Groans} {Roars} {Roaring} -Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon. {Fchoing} -Run! {Gasping} {Screaming} {Roaring} {Screams} {Roars} {Panting, sighs} {Whimpers} {Roars} -You did it! -You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. {Clears throat} -And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed? -I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed. -The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. -Uh, no. -Why not? -I have helmet hair. -Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer. -No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st. -But how will you kiss me? -What? That wasn't in the job description. -Maybe it's a perk. -No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss. -Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love? -Well, yes. {Laughing} -You think Shrek is your true love! -What is so funny? -Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay? -Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet. -Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm not going to. -Take ot off. -No! -Now! -Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. -You- - You're a- - an orge. -Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. -Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an orge. {Sighs} -Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you. -Then why didn't he come rescue me? -Good question. You should ask him that when we get there. -But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - his pet. -So much for noble steed. -You're not making my job any easier. -I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. -Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy. -You wouldn't dare. Put me down! -Ya comin', Donkey? -I'm right behind ya. -Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down! -Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? -You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what happens when you find your - - Hey! {Sighs} -The sooner we get to DuLoc the better. -You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful! -And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like? -Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. {Laughs} -I don't know. There are those who think little of him. -Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad. -Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the ""measuring"" when you see him tomorrow. -Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp? -No, that'll take longer. We can keep going. -But there's robbers in the woods. -Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good. -Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest. -I need to find somewhere to camp now! {Birds wings fluttering} {Grunting} -Hey! Over here. -Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess. -No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. -Homey touches? Like what? {Crashing} -A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. -You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will. -I said good night! -Shrek, What are you doing? {Laughs} -I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding. {Fire cracking} -And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. -Hey, can you tell my future from these stars? -The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for. -I know you're making this up. -No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench. -That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots. -You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it. {Sighs} -Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway? -Our swamp? -You know, when we're through rescuing the princess. -We? Donkey, there's no ""we"". There's no ""our"". There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my land. -You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. -No, do ya think? -Are you hidin' something? -Never mind, Donkey. -Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? -No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things. -Why don't you want to talk about it? -Why do you want to talk about it? -Why are you blocking? -I'm not blocking. -Oh, yes, you are. -Donkey, I'm warning you. -Who you trying to keep out? -Everyone! Okay? -Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. -Oh! For the love of Pete! -What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway? -Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!"" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. -You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly orge. -Yeah, I know. -So, uh, are there any donkeys up there? -Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. -Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there? -That's the moon. -Oh, okay. {Orchestra} {Dulcimer} -Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. -Hmph. -Ah. Perfect. {Inhales} {Snoring} {Vocalizing} {Whistling} {Sizzling} {Sniffs, yawns} -Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. --Come on, baby. I said I like it. -Donkey, wake up. -Huh? What? -Wake up. -What? -Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs? -Good morning, Princess! -What's all this about? -You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me. -Uh, thanks. {Sniffs} -Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. {Belches} -Shrek! -What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs} -Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess. {Belches} -Thanks. -She's as nasty as you are. -{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected. -Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them. {Vocalizing} -La liberte! Hey! -Princess! {Laughs} -What are you doing? -Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from this green - - {Kissing sounds} -beast. -Hey! -That's my princess! Go find you own! -Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here? -Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are! -Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry Men. {Laughs} {Accordion} Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo. I steal from the rich and give to the needy. He takes a wee percentage, But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels Man, I'm good What a guy, Monsieur Hood Break it down I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid What he's basically saying is he likes to get - - Paid So When an orge in the bush grabs a lady by the tush That's bad That's bad When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad He's mad He's really, really mad I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart Keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start {Grunts, Groans} {Karate Yell} {Merry Men Gasping} {Panting} -Man, that was annoying! -Oh, you little- - {Karate Yell} {Accordion} {Shouting, groaning} {Chuckles} -Uh, shall we? -Hold the phone. {Grunts} Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from? -What? -That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that? -Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt! -What? Oh, would you look at that? -Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. -Why? What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt. -Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. -Donkey, I'm okay. -You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich? ",,,,,,,,,,,,

5396,Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, I'm on it. Blue flower, but it has to come out. -No, it's tender. -Now, hold on. -What you're doing is the opposite of help. -Don't move. -Look, time out. -Would you - - {Grunts} -Okay. What do you propose we do? -Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower," red thorns.

5713,lowyat,"Thank you everyone for your replies.Update for future readers:1. I've called up customer service to inquire about this. Termination can be done via phone call, but need to clear off the debts/installments before can proceed.2. Registration for new Maybank credit card can be done online or walk-into branch. However, online application can only mail the credit card to IC registered residential address, unless I request Maybank to alter it which doesn't make sense. For walk-in registration, can choose to mail to temporary address or self-collect in branch.3. For credit card replacement, can also be requested online. Need around 5 business days of lead time - means the card will not be able to be used for the entire duration until a new card is ready. I opted to collect in branch (walk-in).4. Confirmed with bank branch won't affect credit score since this is with Bank Negara's CCRIS, nothing to do with Maybank.Thank you once again for all the help!",,,,,,,,,,,,

I would like to ask some questions....So I have a CDS account with MPlus and I use Maybank to purchase the IPO, by linking it to my MPlus CDS account.If I failed to get it, will the money returned back to my Maybank account or directly credit to MPlus?If I succeeded in getting the IPO, I will see my shares in MPlus portfolio right. But exactly what time can I sell the shares? My hunch is 19 May when bursa open since this is the date they mentioned. Am I right?If you fail the ballot, it will refund to your Maybank account around 10-12 May. Partial refund same to your Maybank. The successful ballot shares will be credited into your CDS account on 19 May 2021 (listing date). Upon open market during listing date i.e. 9am, you can start selling. Successful ballot shares will be exempted from brokerage, stamp duty, etc, but will attract those when you sell as usual. Goodluck mate!  ",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mengikut orang di sana, mereka sudah 3 hari hidup dalam keadaan begini, makan tak cukup, tidur berbumbungkan langit.  pic.twitter.com/5rw0RFhmWL— Steven Sim 🇲🇾 #Bangsa (@scheekeong) May 28, 2021 Sim then met with the couple, only known as Shah and Siti, and put them up at a hotel for the night.The couple told him they couldn’t find a way out of their dire situation.Shah left Kelantan for Penang to build a better life but when they arrived, the movement control order (MCO) came into effect and hampered their hopes.They found shelter at an abandoned building in Taman Bidara.“They have been worried about the outbreak and the MCO’s guidelines, afraid of being detained by the authorities for violating the SOPs,” Sim wrote.“And come next week there will be a full lockdown.”In his heartfelt Facebook post, Sim tried to debunk stereotypes of homeless people.“Shah and Siti are not lazy.“Every day they go out early in the morning until late at night to find discarded cardboard boxes to sell.“Sometimes they would earn RM10 to RM20 a day to bear the cost of food,” he said.Sim added that Siti has a large container which she uses to save the money they earned to rent a place one day.“I was so touched to see this young couple going through thick and thin together.”A female shopper helps Siti with her new tudung. — Picture from Facebook/Steven SimA female shopper helps Siti with her new tudung. — Picture from Facebook/Steven SimTo help Shah and Siti get a head start in life, Sim brought the couple shopping to buy daily essential items for the next two weeks ahead of the full lockdown.He also bought them each a mobile phone so they can contact loved ones and each other, as well as new clothes.“If Shah wants to find work, he has to dress smart.“I asked Siti if she wanted to wear a tudung because I saw she wore one in her IC photograph and she said yes,” said Sim, who bought her a few pieces of tudung.His kindness didn’t stop there.The former youth and sports deputy minister rented a home for the couple and said he will continue paying for the rent until Shah finds a job and they are able to manage financially.Sim has rented a home for the couple and says he will pay for the rent until Shah finds a job. — Picture from Facebook/Steven SimSim has rented a home for the couple and says he will pay for the rent until Shah finds a job. — Picture from Facebook/Steven Sim“At the new house, I called Ustaz Ahmad Fahmi from the Penang Islamic Religious Council to give the young pair religious counselling so they will have the strength to build a new life.“I gifted Shah a copy of the Quran so he can make religion his guide to life and be a good husband and person,” Sim wrote.For those asking, the couple’s cats Tam and Tam have also moved into their new home.Sim, whose Facebook post received 33,000 reactions, called on the public to make a contribution to help the couple.You can make a donation to the account below:Bank: MaybankName: Akaun Khas Pusat Khidmat Parlimen Bukit MertajamAccount number: 557090527361",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mont kiara is a nice placeWe have been renting the unit to Uniglo - it used to be very easy to get Japanese/Korean tenants. Nowadays tenants are very fussy and want furniture rearranged around the unit - my wife doesn't like tenants with a lot of demands. We used to rent it for rm6k/mth six years ago and now rental for a comparable unit is only rm4k. My wife has left the unit empty for more than a year now and an agent was looking after the unit for us. I have asked my wife not to buy the unit in 2014 and she paid rm1.25mil (you probably get one for rm 900k+ nowadays). What can i say since the money is hers so i better shut up. My wife is keen on living her golden years in KL as she is very close to her younger sister so she feels her future lies in Msia. I on the other hand will live anywhere as i am quite easy going and i don't have any kids to worry about. I have left most of my retirement funds in Australia and have transferred a small portion of it back to ringgit (which should last me at least 5 to 6 years). I can easily transfer more funds to Msia as i have developed a good working relationship with the remittance officer in Maybank Bangsar Baru. The Maybank officer was interested in investing the funds that i have moved back to Msia.I got quite a good exchange rate when i transferred using Maybank telegraphic transfer (around 3.15) from CBA. I like the CBA online transfer (max limit A$50k) and fee is only A$22 per transaction. It is so convenient for me to just move my retirement funds back to Msia using the online website. However, i don't think i will need any more Msian ringgit for a long while  ",,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought of paying back in 2 - 3 days time when the credit came in. But holy crap I did not expect the fees to be RM300 I had a heart attack when I saw that number ... RM300 for fees ??? Apparently it's called a Cash Advanced Fee. I called Maybank and they ask if I gambled. I said I bought some BTC, and he said that the fees for gambling and Binance is the same... Which is 5% on the transacted amount and 18%p.a Daily interest !!! 18%!!!! I had no clue. So anyone had any experience with this?Almost did the same a while ago with the same thought in mind, buying directly with card sounds a whole lot easierluckily i did some searches on related discussions and saw people said its super expensive on fees so i went back to p2p",,,,,,,,,,,,

6028,lowyat,"QUOTE(xpole @ May 23 2021, 09:44 PM)What happened to Wechat pay?Last time I can see many merchants can accept it. Nowadays I can see most of the merchants are focusing on using Maybank qr pay, boost, touch n go or grab pay onlyIn Kuching, what I can see is the other way round. More merchants are accepting Wechat Pay MY. Previously I can hardly see any Wechat Pay MY accepted except in KK Supermart, Starbucks, Petron, Boulevard supermarket, Tealive and llhaolhao. Now more accepting it, like at Nando's, Parkson, Mr DIY, Pizza Hut, Sakae Sushi, Harvey Norman...However, need to note that these merchants accept Wechat Pay MY not because they specifically apply for it (I think la). In fact Wechat Pay MY is included as a ""package"" when the merchants apply with GHL, a payment service provider for cashless payment. So along with other more active players like Grab Pay, TNG, Boost, Alipay, then plus one Wechat Pay MY at the back of the package list offerd by GHL. If you ask which shop has Wechat Pay MY as a standalone sticker pasted on their payment counter, I cannot recall much. I am really curious if anyone is really using Wechat Pay MY to pay - I mean, it is no doubt a good convenient cashless method because users no need to download additional app (if they already have Wechat), but since other players are offering points and cashbacks, they are much more attractive. Second reason why Wechat Pay MY is leaving behind would be due to the government initiative to choose TNG, Grab and Boost as the official e-wallets to give away money. Of course these three wallets enjoy higher status and popularity both between the merchants and consumers. Third reason is the way Wechat Pay MY advertise itself. A lot of people do not even know Wechat Pay MY has been launched and can be used in Malaysia. Some shops have ""微信支付"", which means only Wechat Pay China wallet is available. Only when it is displayed in English as ""Wechat Pay MY"", then it means Malaysian wallet can be used. Don't you think this will only create confusions among the users?Anyway, as what I have been saying, the main reason would be Malaysian Wechat Pay team not performing, to put it simple. You see, under the current covid situation, everybody is going towards online ordering, be it service or food, yet Wechat Pay Malaysian team just sits there doing nothing, such a waste to lose its privilege (as in the successful experience obtained by Wechat Pay in China) and its potential customers. Wechat Pay MY has an office in Mid Valley, but I really wonder what do their staff do everyday?On their Facebook page, for the past 1 year they rather spent time and effort posting promotional posters on all kinds of festive greetings, but no other practical promotions or useful tips to help users learn more about Wechat Pay MY. It is just so... pathetic.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its easy to get one, even if you may not be fully set up for the requirements - most companies generally are happy to have an extra hand for cheap/nothing. I know a friend who rose up the ladder in this way - eventually found himself on a fast track management training programe - skip the exec line, make bosses happy, instant manager when done.
